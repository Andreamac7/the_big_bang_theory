0,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If it’s unobserved it will, however, if it’s observed after it’s left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits."
1,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Agreed, what’s your point?"
2,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"There’s no point, I just think it’s a good idea for a tee-shirt."
3,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Excuse me?
4,1,1,pilot episode,Receptionist,Hang on.
5,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc’s capital idea, that’s Port-au-Prince. Haiti."
6,1,1,pilot episode,Receptionist,Can I help you?
7,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?"
8,1,1,pilot episode,Receptionist,"If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn’t be here."
9,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,I think this is the place.
10,1,1,pilot episode,Receptionist,Fill these out.
11,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Thank-you. We’ll be right back.
12,1,1,pilot episode,Receptionist,"Oh, take your time. I’ll just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh wait."
13,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Leonard, I don’t think I can do this."
14,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"What, are you kidding? You’re a semi-pro."
15,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"No. We are committing genetic fraud. There’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers."
16,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment."
17,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there’s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn’t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve."
18,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,I’m sure she’ll still love him.
19,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,I wouldn’t.
20,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Well, what do you want to do?"
21,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,I want to leave.
22,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Okay.
23,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,What’s the protocol for leaving?
24,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"I don’t know, I’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before."
25,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Let’s try just walking out.
26,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Okay.
27,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Bye-bye
28,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,See you.
29,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
30,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,No.
31,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
32,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Not really.
33,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip."
34,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,I don’t care. Two millimetres? That doesn’t seem right.
35,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"No, it’s true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle."
36,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
37,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"No, that was the result of my work with lasers."
38,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,New neighbour?
39,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Evidently.
40,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Significant improvement over the old neighbour.
41,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is."
42,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Oh, hi!"
43,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Hi.
44,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Hi.
45,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Hi.
46,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Hi.
47,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,Hi?
48,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"We don’t mean to interrupt, we live across the hall."
49,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Oh, that’s nice."
50,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms."
51,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Oh, okay, well, guess I’m your new neighbour, Penny."
52,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Leonard, Sheldon."
53,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,Hi.
54,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Hi.
55,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Hi.
56,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,Hi.
57,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building."
58,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Thankyou, maybe we can have coffee sometime."
59,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Oh, great."
60,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,Great.
61,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Great.
62,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Great. Well, bye."
63,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,Bye.
64,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Bye.
65,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Bye.
66,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Should we have invited her for lunch?
67,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,No. We’re going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.
68,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
69,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Not with commentary.
70,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome."
71,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.
72,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle."
73,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
74,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Yes, and you’ve never met one of them."
75,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,That’s the beauty of it.
76,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,I’m going to invite her over. We’ll have a nice meal and chat.
77,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Chat? We don’t chat. At least not offline.
78,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Well it’s not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response."
79,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,To what end?
80,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Hi. Again.
81,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,Hi.
82,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Hi.
83,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Hi.
84,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,Hi.
85,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I’m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don’t have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about."
86,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements."
87,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Oh, you’re inviting me over to eat?"
88,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Uh, yes."
89,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Oh, that’s so nice, I’d love to."
90,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Great.
91,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"So, what do you guys do for fun around here?"
92,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Well, today we tried masturbating for money."
93,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Okay, well, make yourself at home."
94,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Okay, thankyou."
95,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,You’re very welcome.
96,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?"
97,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Actually that’s my work.
98,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,Wow.
99,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation."
100,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"So you’re like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys."
101,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Yeah.
102,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,This is really impressive.
103,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board."
104,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,Holy smokes.
105,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at MIT, sure."
106,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,What?
107,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Oh, come on. Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?”"
108,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,At least I didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
109,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"I didn’t invent them, they’re there."
110,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,In what universe?
111,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"In all of them, that is the point."
112,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Uh, do you guys mind if I start?"
113,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Um, Penny, that’s where I sit."
114,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"So, sit next to me."
115,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"No, I sit there."
116,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,What’s the difference?
117,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,What’s the difference?
118,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Here we go.
119,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point."
120,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,Do you want me to move?
121,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Well.
122,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Just sit somewhere else.
123,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Sheldon, sit!"
124,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Aaah!
125,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Well this is nice. We don’t have a lot of company over.
126,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time.
127,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Yes I now, but…"
128,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.
129,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Yes, I remember."
130,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,I resent you saying we don’t have company.
131,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,I’m sorry.
132,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,That is an antisocial implication.
133,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,I said I’m sorry.
134,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"So, Klingon boggle?"
135,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That’s probably enough about us, tell us about you."
136,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Um, me, okay, I’m Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know."
137,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality."
138,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,Participate in the what?
139,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"I think what Sheldon’s trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess."
140,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I’m a water sign. Okay, let’s see, what else, oh, I’m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak."
141,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn.
142,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?"
143,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Oh, yeah, I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory."
144,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Oh, okay. I love cheesecake."
145,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,You’re lactose intolerant.
146,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"I don’t eat it, I just think it’s a good idea."
147,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Oh, anyways, I’m also writing a screenplay. It’s about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory."
148,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,So it’s based on your life?
149,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"No, I’m from Omaha."
150,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Well, if that was a movie I would go see it."
151,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"I know, right? Okay, let’s see, what else? Um, that’s about it. That’s the story of Penny."
152,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Well it sounds wonderful.
153,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk.
154,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,What’s happening.
155,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,I don’t know.
156,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that’s like as long as High School."
157,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,It took you four years to get through High School?
158,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Don’t.
159,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.
160,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"You? No, you’ll only make it worse."
161,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?"
162,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Yes.
163,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"No, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn’t make it worse."
164,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m such a mess, and on top of everything else I’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work."
165,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Our shower works.
166,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?
167,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Yes.
168,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,No.
169,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,No?
170,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,No.
171,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,No.
172,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,It’s right down the hall.
173,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Well this is an interesting development.
174,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,How so?
175,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
176,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"That’s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer’s had that episode."
177,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out.
178,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
179,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?"
180,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Excuse me?
181,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you.
182,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Well I’m not trying to have sex with her.
183,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed."
184,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, I’m a male and she’s a female?"
185,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Yes, but not of the same species."
186,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I’m just trying to be a good neighbour."
187,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Oh, of course."
188,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,That’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn’t participate. However briefly.
189,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
190,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,Wait till you see this.
191,1,1,pilot episode,Raj,It’s fantastic. Unbelievable.
192,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,See what?
193,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,It’s a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
194,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,This is not a good time.
195,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,It’s before he became a creepy computer voice
196,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"That’s great, you guys have to go."
197,1,1,pilot episode,Raj,Why?
198,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,It’s just not a good time.
199,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Leonard has a lady over.
200,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,"Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?"
201,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"No. And she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour."
202,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,"Hang on, there really is a lady here?"
203,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Uh-huh.
204,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,And you want us out because you’re anticipating coitus?
205,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,I’m not anticipating coitus.
206,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,So she’s available for coitus?
207,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Technically that would be coitus interruptus.
208,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!"
209,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,"Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it’s currently orbiting Jupiter’s largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs."
210,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.
211,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Come on, I’ll show you the trick with the shower."
212,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,Bon douche.
213,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,I’m sorry?
214,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,It’s French for good shower. It’s a sentiment I can express in six languages.
215,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Save it for your blog, Howard."
216,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,See-ka-tong-guay-jow.
217,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I’m sorry."
218,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"You’re welcome, oh, you’re going to step right, okay, I’ll…."
219,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Hey, Leonard?"
220,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,The hair products are Sheldon’s.
221,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour."
222,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you."
223,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,It’s okay if you say no.
224,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Oh, I’ll probably say yes."
225,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,It’s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you’ve just met.
226,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Wow.
227,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
228,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Must we?
229,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman’s ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?"
230,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon."
231,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause."
232,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Which is?
233,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,You think with your penis.
234,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,That’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come.
235,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can’t she get her own TV."
236,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Come on, you know how it is with break-ups."
237,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,No I don’t. And neither do you.
238,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim."
239,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea."
240,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There’s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
241,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,So we get to have a scene with him?
242,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"No, Sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. There’s two of us and one of him."
243,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Leonard, the two of us can’t even carry a TV."
244,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?"
245,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Uh, I’m sorry, do you speak English?"
246,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,"Oh, he speaks English, he just can’t speak to women."
247,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Really, why?"
248,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,He’s kind of a nerd. Juice box?
249,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,I’ll do the talking.
250,1,1,pilot episode,Voice from buzzer,Yeah.
251,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Hi, I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon."
252,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Hello.
253,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"What did I just…. Uh, we’re here to pick up Penny’s TV."
254,1,1,pilot episode,Voice,Get lost.
255,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Okay, thanks for your time."
256,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,We’re not going to give up just like that.
257,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Leonard, the TV is in the building, we’ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done."
258,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang."
259,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,My apologies. What’s your plan.
260,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,It’s just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
261,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building."
262,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,What do you think their combined IQ is?
263,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Just grab the door.
264,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,This is it.
265,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Good thinking, I’ll just be the muscle."
266,1,1,pilot episode,Enormous man,Yeah?
267,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon."
268,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,From the intercom.
269,1,1,pilot episode,Man,How the hell did you get in the building?
270,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Oh. We’re scientists.
271,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Tell him about our IQ.
272,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Leonard.
273,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,What?
274,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,My mom bought me those pants.
275,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,I’m sorry.
276,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,You’re going to have to call her.
277,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m so sorry I dragged you through this."
278,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"It’s okay. It wasn’t my first pantsing, and it won’t be my last."
279,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex."
280,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Well you got me out of my pants.
281,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Anyway, I’ve learned my lesson. She’s out of my league, I’m done with her, I’ve got my work, one day I’ll win the Nobel Prize and then I’ll die alone."
282,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Don’t think like that, you’re not going to die alone."
283,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Thank you Sheldon, you’re a good friend."
284,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,And you’re certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.
285,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,"This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale."
286,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Wow, cool tiger."
287,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,"Yeah, I’ve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest."
288,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Uh, sounds interesting."
289,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,So you’ll think about it?
290,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Oh, I don’t think I’ll be able to stop thinking about it."
291,1,1,pilot episode,Raj,Smooth.
292,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,We’re home.
293,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Oh, my God, what happened?"
294,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory."
295,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"I’m so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn’t be such an ass."
296,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,"No, it was a valid hypothesis."
297,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?
298,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,"Really, thank you so much for going and trying you’re, uh, you’re so terrific. Why don’t you put some clothes on, I’ll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?"
299,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Really? Great.
300,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"Thank you. You’re not done with her, are you?"
301,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Our babies will be smart and beautiful.
302,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,Not to mention imaginary.
303,1,1,pilot episode,Leonard,Is Thai food okay with you Penny?
304,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,Sure.
305,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"We can’t have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch."
306,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,So?
307,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,They’re both curry based cuisines.
308,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,So?
309,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we’re going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
310,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.
311,1,1,pilot episode,Penny,That sounds like fun.
312,1,1,pilot episode,Howard,"Baby, baby don’t get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don’t get hooked on me."
313,1,1,pilot episode,Sheldon,"I don’t know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you’re a veritable Mack Daddy."
314,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"There you go, Pad Thai, no peanuts."
315,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,But does it have peanut oil?
316,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Uh, I’m not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up."
317,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Since it’s not bee season, you can have my epinephrine."
318,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Raj,Are there any chopsticks?
319,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"You don’t need chopsticks, this is Thai food."
320,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,Here we go.
321,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don’t actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth."
322,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Ask him for a napkin, I dare you."
323,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,I’ll get it.
324,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.
325,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,Hey Leonard.
326,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, hi Penny."
327,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,Am I interrupting.
328,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,No.
329,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"You’re not swelling, Howard."
330,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,"No, no, look at my fingers, they’re like Vienna sausages."
331,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,Sounds like you have company.
332,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,They’re not going anywhere.
333,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Well, you know, it’s the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them."
334,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system."
335,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was…."
336,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,Yes.
337,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Oh. Okay, great, I’m having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, so…."
338,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,I’m sorry?
339,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,Haven’t you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?
340,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"No, I haven’t."
341,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,Get used to it.
342,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah, I probably won’t, but… Hey Sheldon."
343,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,Hi.
344,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Hey Raj!  Still not talking to me, huh?"
345,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Don’t take it personally, it’s his pathology, he can’t talk to women."
346,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,"He can’t talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake–scented Goddess!"
347,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"So, there’s gonna be some furniture delivered?"
348,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I’m not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment."
349,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, no problem."
350,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Great, here’s my spare key. Thank you."
351,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Penny, wait."
352,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,Yeah?
353,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Um, if you don’t have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?"
354,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?"
355,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"You’re kidding, right?"
356,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?"
357,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,"Leonard,Sheldon and Howard together",One.
358,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
359,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Yes, I know, men can’t fly."
360,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Oh no, let’s assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces."
361,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates."
362,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"In what space, sir, in what space? She’s two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he’d let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death."
363,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength."
364,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth’s yellow Sun."
365,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,"Yeah, and you don’t have a problem with that, how does he fly at night."
366,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Uh, a combination of the moon’s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells."
367,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,I’m just going to go wash up.
368,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells."
369,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,Challenge accepted.  We’re locked out.
370,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Raj,"Also, the pretty girl left."
371,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay, her apartment’s on the fourth floor but the elevator’s broken so you’re going to have to  oh, you’re just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we’ll just bring it up ourselves."
372,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,I hardly think so.
373,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,Why not?
374,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Well, we don’t have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength."
375,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"We don’t need strength, we’re physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it’s just a matter…"
376,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,Archimedes would be so proud.
377,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,Do you have any ideas?
378,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring."
379,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Easy, easy"
380,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay! Now we’ve got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half."
381,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,Exactly half.
382,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Exactly half. Let’s push. Okay, see, it’s moving, this is easy, all in the math."
383,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,What’s your formula for the corner.
384,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn."
385,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch."
386,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?
387,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,Men do things for women without expecting sex.
388,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Yeah, those are men who just had sex."
389,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"I’m doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there’s no way it could lower the odds."
390,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"No we’re not, no we’re not, no we’re not."
391,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!"
392,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,You okay?
393,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"No, it hurt…"
394,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Great Caesar’s Ghost, look at this place?"
395,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,So Penny’s a little messy.
396,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I’m just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table’s having a tiny garage sale."
397,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?"
398,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,No.
399,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Well they don’t. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don’t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content."
400,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Excuse me, but I think we’ve both found that helpful at times."
401,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Come on, we should go."
402,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,Hang on.
403,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,What are you doing?
404,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,Straightening up.
405,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Sheldon, this is not your home."
406,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"This is not anyone’s home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy."
407,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"When the transvestite lived here, you didn’t care how he kept the place."
408,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man’s closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms."
409,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,What were you doing in his closet?
410,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,I helped run some cable for a webcam.
411,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,Hey guys.
412,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now."
413,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?
414,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,No.
415,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,No?
416,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,No.
417,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,No.
418,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Well, we’ll get out of your hair."
419,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Oh, great, thank you again"
420,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Penny, I just want you to know that, you don’t have to live like this. I’m here for you."
421,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,What’s he talking about?
422,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,It’s a joke.
423,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,I don’t get it.
424,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, he didn’t tell it right."
425,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,Sheldon?
426,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,Sheldon? Hello?
427,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,Sheldon!
428,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,Sssshhhh! Penny’s sleeping.
429,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Are you insane, you can’t just break into a woman’s apartment in the middle of the night and clean."
430,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"I had no choice. I couldn’t sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was… this."
431,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here?"
432,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
433,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"No, no. You gave me an explanation, it’s reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers."
434,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,Don’t be ridiculous. I have no peers.
435,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Sheldon, we have to get out of here."
436,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,You might want to speak in a lower register.
437,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,What?
438,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they’ll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register."
439,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"No,  that’s ridiculous."
440,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Fine. I accept your premise, now please let’s go."
441,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,I am not leaving until I’m done.
442,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,O-o-o-oh!
443,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"If you have time to lean, you have time to clean."
444,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, what the hell."
445,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,Morning.
446,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,Morning.
447,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well."
448,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,I’m not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour’s apartment and clean.
449,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
450,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,You think?
451,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny’s quality of life."
452,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"You know what, you’ve convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet."
453,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,You don’t think that crosses a line?
454,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Yes! For God’s sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth."
455,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,You have a sarcasm sign?
456,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"No, I do not have a sarcasm sign."
457,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Do you want some cereal. I’m feeling so good today I’m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs."
458,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,Son of a Bitch!
459,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,Penny’s up.
460,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"You sick, geeky bastards!"
461,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,How did she know it was us?
462,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.
463,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,Leonard!
464,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"God, this is going to be bad."
465,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran."
466,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?
467,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Yes, but, only to clean."
468,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Really more to organise, you’re not actually dirty, per se."
469,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,Give me back my key.
470,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"I’m very, very sorry."
471,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,Do you understand how creepy this is.
472,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night."
473,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"In my apartment, while I was sleeping."
474,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"And snoring. And that’s probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It’s a throat doctor."
475,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
476,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Depending on the depth, that’s either a proctologist or a general surgeon."
477,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,God!
478,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you’re feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you’re feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more."
479,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,Stay away from me.
480,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Sure, that’s another way to go."
481,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm."
482,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,Well that was a little non-responsive.
483,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise.
484,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,What’s funny?
485,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,That wasn’t sarcasm?
486,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,No.
487,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning.  I have a masters and two PhD’s, I should not have to do this."
488,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,What?
489,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won’t colour your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.  I did what I could."
490,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,Hey Raj.
491,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Hey, listen, I don’t know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I’m really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?"
492,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Raj,"Ooh, she’s standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?"
493,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don’t shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?"
494,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Raj,"She’s so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I’d be better off with an Indian girl. We’d have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me."
495,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"It’s obvious that they meant well, but I’m just, I’m having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it’s just freaking me out."
496,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"I mean, just because most of the men I’ve known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn’t mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?"
497,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,"Grab a napkin, homie. You just got served."
498,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,It’s fine. You win.
499,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,What’s his problem?
500,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
501,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,Been there.
502,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Raj,"Hello. Sorry I’m late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny."
503,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,"Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?"
504,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Raj,"Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee."
505,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,What did she say? Is she still mad at me?
506,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Raj,"Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and… then she hugged me."
507,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,She hugged you? How did she hug you?
508,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,Is that her perfume I smell?
509,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Raj,"intoxicating, isn’t it?"
510,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,Hi.
511,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,Oh.
512,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,What’s going on?
513,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Um, here’s the thing."
514,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one’s mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie’s discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research…."
515,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,Leonard.
516,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,Yeah.
517,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,Six two inch dowels.
518,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,Check.
519,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"One package, Phillips head screws."
520,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,Check.
521,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre."
522,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"No, please, we insist, it’s the least we can do considering."
523,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,Considering what? How great this place looks?
524,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,"Oh boy, I was afraid of this."
525,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,What?
526,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.
527,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store."
528,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted."
529,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,We could put her stereo back there.
530,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,And control it how?
531,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy."
532,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,"Good point, how you gonna cool it?"
533,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Hey guys, I got this."
534,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?"
535,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Also inefficient, and might be loud."
536,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,"How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC…"
537,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Guys, this is actually really simple."
538,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,"Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here."
539,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?"
540,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,And if water is involved we’re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.
541,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Guys, it’s hot in here, I think I’ll just take off all my clothes."
542,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, I’ve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium."
543,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Sheldon,"Right, then the entire thing’s one big heat sink."
544,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,"Perfect, Leonard, why don’t you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch."
545,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,Meet back here in an hour?
546,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Howard,Done.
547,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Leonard,Got it.
548,1,2,the big bran hypothesis,Penny,"Okay, this place does look pretty good."
549,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"Alright, just a few more feet, and…. here we are gentlemen, the Gates of Elzebub."
550,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Good lord!
551,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Raj,Oooh.
552,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Don’t panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about."
553,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"Stay frosty, there’s a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth."
554,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands."
555,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Lock and load.
556,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"Raj, blow up the gates."
557,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Raj,"Blowing the gates. Control, shift, B! Oh, my God, so many goblins!"
558,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"Don’t just stand there, slash and move, slash and move."
559,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Stay in formation.
560,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"Leonard, you’ve got one on your tail."
561,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"That’s alright, my tail’s prehensile, I’ll swat him off."
562,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Raj,I’ve got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!
563,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Raj, no, it’s a trap, they’re flanking us!"
564,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Raj,"Oooh, he’s got me."
565,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"Sheldon, he’s got Raj, use your sleath spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!"
566,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,I’ve got the Sword of Azeroth!
567,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj."
568,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!"
569,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,Leonard look out!
570,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Dammit man, we’re dying here."
571,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Goodbye, peasants."
572,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,The bastard teleported.
573,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Raj,He’s selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.
574,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"You betrayed us for money, who are you?"
575,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"I’m a rogue knight elf, don’t you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked “buy it now.”"
576,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,I am the Swordmaster!
577,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Wooh, I’m all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, I just built a virtual pool."
578,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"No, I can’t look at you or your avatar right now."
579,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,Sounds like your neighbour’s home.
580,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Excuse me.
581,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Don’t forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you’d have an excuse to talk to her.
582,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Oh, right, right right right right."
583,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it."
584,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Penny, the mailman did it again, he…"
585,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Oh! Sorry.
586,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Um, no, hi Leonard, this is Doug, Doug, this is my neighbour Leonard."
587,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Doug,What’s up bro.
588,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Not much. Bro.
589,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Is, is everything okay."
590,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here."
591,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Thank you, I’ve got to talk to that mailman."
592,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Oh no, that’s probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap."
593,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Okay, well, thank you, again."
594,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro!"
595,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Penny for your thoughts.
596,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Raj,What’s the matter.
597,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"No, I’m fine. Penny’s fine, the guy she’s kissing is really fine and…"
598,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French?"
599,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,What is wrong with you?
600,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,I’m a romantic.
601,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Please don’t tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.
602,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"No, I’m not jealous, I’m just a little concerned for her. I didn’t like the look of the guy that she was with."
603,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,Because he looked better than you?
604,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.
605,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don’t crash into geek mountain again."
606,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"I disagree, love is not a sprint, it’s a marathon. A relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. Or hits you with the pepper spray."
607,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Well, I’m done with Penny. I’m going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed."
608,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Raj,Like who?
609,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,I don’t know. Olivia Geiger?
610,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?
611,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Yeah.
612,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Well, I don’t think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability."
613,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"I don’t know, you guys work in the same lab."
614,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,So?
615,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"There are pitfalls, trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law I’m… a bit of a self-taught expert."
616,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, I’m not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me."
617,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"Oh, then you’re probably okay."
618,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Hello Lesley.
619,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Lesley,Hi Leonard.
620,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.
621,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Lesley,"Goggles, Leonard."
622,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment."
623,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Lesley,Hang on. I’m trying to see how long it takes a five hundred kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup o’ noodles.
624,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Pfff, I’ve done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay."
625,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Lesley,"Wait, are you asking me out?"
626,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. But we don’t need to quibble over terminology."
627,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Lesley,What sort of experiment would you propose?
628,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock."
629,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Lesley,Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the bio-chemical reaction during the goodnight kiss.
630,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes."
631,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Lesley,"Well, why don’t we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable."
632,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"You mean, kiss you now?"
633,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Lesley,Yes.
634,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Can you define the parameters of the kiss?
635,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Lesley,Closed mouth but romantic. Mint?
636,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Thank you.
637,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,. Shall I count down from three?
638,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Lesley,"No, I think it needs to be spontaneous."
639,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Lesley,What do you think.
640,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first."
641,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Lesley,"Fair enough. On the plus side, it was a good kiss, reasonable technique, no extraneous spittle. On the other hand, no arousal."
642,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,None?
643,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Lesley,None.
644,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Ah. Well, thank you for your time."
645,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Lesley,Thank you.
646,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,None at all?
647,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn’t, would you want me to tell you?"
648,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"That depends. When I learn that I’m a robot, will I be able to handle it?"
649,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side."
650,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I’m a robot, would I be bound by Asimov’s three laws of robotics?"
651,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Raj,You might be bound by them right now.
652,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"That’s true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?"
653,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Of course not.
654,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?"
655,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Well, no."
656,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,I smell robot.
657,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Hey, what’s going on."
658,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,The internet’s been down for half an hour.
659,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Raj,"Also, Sheldon may be a robot."
660,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"So, how did it go with Lesley?"
661,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway."
662,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Oh, I’ve seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don’t know if I can take it."
663,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Raj,You could power down.
664,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"Well, as usual, Wolowitz has the solution. I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and Leonard could have his pick."
665,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Class instructor,"Remember the Latin hips. Shoulders stay still, and we sway. One two three. Five six seven."
666,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Howard,"I think Mrs Tishman’s got her eye on you. I’ve been there, you’re in for a treat."
667,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Oh, good lord."
668,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"God, that’s a good song."
669,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,If you’re compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.
670,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you."
671,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"I know what you’re thinking, I’ve taken your asthma into account. There’s a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos."
672,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Leonard, listen to me…"
673,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"I’ve been thinking about names, I’m kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots."
674,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?"
675,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Maybe, if it’s a cute little cuddly cat."
676,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny."
677,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"It doesn’t matter. The woman’s not interested in me, the woman rejected me."
678,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out."
679,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"You’re right. I didn’t ask her out, I should ask her out."
680,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, don’t buy a cat."
681,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"No, but you’re right. I should march over there and ask her out."
682,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Oh, goody, we’re getting a cat."
683,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Ah, hey Leonard."
684,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh… I was wondering if you had plans for dinner."
685,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?"
686,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper."
687,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,Supper?
688,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time."
689,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Uh, six thirty’s great."
690,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Really? Great!
691,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys."
692,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Us guys?
693,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who all’s coming?"
694,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"They…. might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn’t, it’s no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu."
695,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun."
696,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Great. Did we say a time?
697,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,Six thirty.
698,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,And that’s still good for you.
699,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,It’s fine.
700,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Cos it’s not carved in stone.
701,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"No, six thirty’s great."
702,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,I’ll get my chisel.
703,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,Why?
704,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"To… carve the… okay, I’ll see you six thirty."
705,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,How do I look?
706,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Could you be more specific?
707,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Can you tell I’m perspiring a little?
708,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?
709,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Six thirty.
710,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate."
711,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Is it too much?
712,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Not if you’re a rugby team.
713,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn’t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos."
714,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Why would I join you?
715,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn’t such a good idea."
716,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, no, well now, there’s always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening."
717,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"You’re right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well."
718,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Of course, there’s the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code."
719,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,You could have stopped at “it could go well.”
720,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"If I could of, I would of."
721,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"I mean, I’m a perfectly nice guy. There’s no reason we couldn’t go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, “you love pottery? I love pottery!” You know, there’s a pause, we both know what’s happening, I lean in, we kiss, it’s a little tentative at first but then I realise, she’s kissing me back, and she’s biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we’re going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!"
722,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Is the sex starting now?
723,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,I’m having a panic attack.
724,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Oh, okay, well then, calm down."
725,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"If I could calm down I wouldn’t be having a panic attack, that’s why they call it a panic attack."
726,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes."
727,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Why?
728,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Just do it.
729,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Okay.
730,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.
731,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,What?
732,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"It’s a bio-feedback technique, it’s relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere."
733,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Oh, who am I kidding, I can’t go through with this, you need to call her and cancel."
734,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Me?
735,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Yes.
736,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,What should I tell her.
737,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,I don’t know. Tell her I’m sick.
738,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Okay.
739,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she’ll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again."
740,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Got it. So I’m assuming nothing venereal. I’ll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven’t quite bounced back.
741,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Give me the phone.
742,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,But I thought you wanted to cancel?
743,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,I can’t because if I don’t show up she’ll still be expecting you.
744,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Why would she be expecting me?
745,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower."
746,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
747,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn’t quite bounced back yet."
748,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy."
749,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"You’re kidding, well, then, that’s something we have in common."
750,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,How?
751,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,We both have people in our lives who… want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.
752,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"So, what’s new in the world of physics?"
753,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Nothing.
754,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Really, nothing?"
755,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930’s, and you can’t prove string theory, at best you can say “hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.”"
756,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,Ah. Well I’m sure things will pick up.
757,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,What’s new at the Cheesecake Factory?
758,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that’s moving pretty well."
759,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend."
760,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, he’s nice and funny, but…"
761,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Waitress,Can I get you started with some drinks?
762,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"No,"
763,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"You were saying, but…"
764,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,I’d like a drink.
765,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Just say the but thing about Doug and then I’ll get her back.
766,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Okay, well, you know, it’s just me. I’m still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex."
767,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Ugh, don’t get me started on rebound sex."
768,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"It’s just, it’s my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it’s just thirty six meaningless of… well, you know."
769,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"I’m not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one… glorious summer."
770,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"No, it’s usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it."
771,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Well, chafing, right?"
772,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,Emotionally.
773,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool? (Penny nods.) I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it."
774,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,How?
775,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Wow, centrifugal force!"
776,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,Are you okay?
777,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Yeah, I’m okay. Did you spill ketchup?"
778,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,No.
779,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,I’m not okay.
780,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,Are you sure you don’t want to go to the emergency room?
781,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"No, no, I’m okay, it’s stopped bleeding."
782,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"I know, but you did throw up. Isn’t that a sign of a concussion?"
783,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Yes, but I get car sick too, so…"
784,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,Okay.
785,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"Sorry about your car, by the way."
786,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Oh, no, it’s fine, you got most of it out the window."
787,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.
788,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Yeah, me too. Um, good night."
789,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,Leonard?
790,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Yeah.
791,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,Was this supposed to be a date?
792,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn’t show up, because of work and a colonoscopy."
793,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Penny,"Okay, I was just checking."
794,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,"When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she’s been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, I’m going to go lay down for a while, good night."
795,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,"So, how was your date?"
796,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Leonard,Awesome!
797,1,3,the fuzzy boots ,Sheldon,Score one for liquor and poor judgement.
798,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,I’ve been thinking about time travel again.
799,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,"Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?"
800,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I’d just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place."
801,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Interesting.
802,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Yeah, it really takes the pressure off."
803,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"It’s time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that."
804,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Then I guess congratulations are in order.
805,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I’m not going to enjoy this party."
806,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,"I know, I’m familiar with you."
807,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes."
808,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,"Yes, I was there."
809,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"You know what’s interesting about caves, Leonard?"
810,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,What?
811,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Nothing.
812,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,"Well then we’ll avoid Finkleday, we’ll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go."
813,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"How’s this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you’ve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo."
814,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Mahalo’s a nice touch.
815,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.
816,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,"Interesting, you should lead with that."
817,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Raj,"Oh, God, Look at this buffet. I love America."
818,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,You don’t have buffets in India?
819,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Raj,"Of course, but it’s all Indian food. You can’t find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me."
820,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Well here’s an interesting turn of events.
821,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,What.
822,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Howard brought a date?
823,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.
824,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Summer,"I already told you, touching’s extra."
825,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Howard,Right. Sorry.
826,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,"Here comes our new boss, be polite."
827,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Gablehouser,"Hi fellas, Eric Gablehouser."
828,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Howard,Howard Wolowitz.
829,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Gablehouser,"Howard, nice to meet you, and you are?"
830,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,An actual real scientist.
831,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,How was that?
832,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,I can’t believe he fired me.
833,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,"Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
834,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"In my defence, I prefaced that by saying “with all due respect.”"
835,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Morning
836,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Morning.
837,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,You’re making eggs for breakfast?
838,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"This isn’t breakfast, it’s an experiment."
839,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.
840,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste."
841,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.
842,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,As do I.
843,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,"You know, I’m sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back."
844,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"I don’t want my job back. I’ve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I’m going to savour it."
845,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Okay. I’ll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
846,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"I’m not just fixing my eggs, I’m fixing everyone’s eggs."
847,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,And we all thank you.
848,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Use new eggs.
849,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence."
850,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,I’m sorry?
851,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.
852,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,Four dozen?
853,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo."
854,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,"Okay, one more time?"
855,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Never mind, you won’t get it right, I’d better come with you."
856,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,"Oh, yay!"
857,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,How come you didn’t go into work today.
858,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"I’m taking a sabbatical, because I won’t kow-tow to mediocre minds."
859,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,"So you got canned, huh?"
860,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah.
861,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,"Well, maybe it’s all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens."
862,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"No it doesn’t. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved."
863,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,"No, no, I meant…"
864,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
865,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,Never mind.
866,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Slow down. Slow down, please slow down."
867,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,We’re fine.
868,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Look, you’re not leaving yourself enough space between cars."
869,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,"Oh, sure I am."
870,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let’s say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you."
871,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,120?
872,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?"
873,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,"Well, yeah."
874,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let’s say, 4,400lb."
875,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,"Let’s say 4,390."
876,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Fine. We’re travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let’s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we’ll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and… oh look, they built a new put-put course."
877,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives."
878,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,Thank you.
879,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes."
880,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,"Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn’t you say you needed some eggs."
881,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket."
882,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,"Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then."
883,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you’ll really enjoy this, is, they’re shelved with the vegetables, but they’re technically a fruit."
884,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,Interesting.
885,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Isn’t it?
886,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,"No, I mean what you find enjoyable."
887,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Oh boy.
888,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,What now?
889,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Well, there’s some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you’re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine."
890,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,"Well, maybe that’s what I was going for."
891,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Well then you’ll want some manganese.
892,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.
893,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,"Oh, I don’t know Sheldon, it’s going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today."
894,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month’s supply at a time."
895,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,What?
896,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Well think about it, it’s a product that doesn’t spoil, and you’re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years."
897,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?
898,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?"
899,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,"Okay, I’m not talking about this with you."
900,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we’re talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular?"
901,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Okay, no warehouse store, but we’re still on for put-put golf, right?"
902,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard (entering),"Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something."
903,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,I think it’s her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference.
904,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,What’s with the fish?
905,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,It’s an experiment.
906,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,What happened to your scrambled egg research?
907,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they’re ever going to be."
908,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,So… fish.
909,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights."
910,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Fish nightlights.
911,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,It’s a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!
912,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,"Mum’s the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don’t want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back."
913,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, no. No, I’ve too much to do."
914,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Like luminous fish.
915,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Shhhhh!
916,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Right… I didn’t….
917,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"That’s just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, we’re going to be rich."
918,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Thank you for coming on such short notice.
919,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,You did the right thing calling.
920,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,"I didn’t know what else to do, he’s lost all focus, every day he’s got a new obsession."
921,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,This is a particularly disturbing one.
922,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Mommy.
923,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,Hi baby.
924,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,You called my mother?
925,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, you got yourself a loom, how nice."
926,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Thank you.
927,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Honey, why did you get a loom?"
928,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?"
929,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,Leonard called me.
930,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"I know, but why?"
931,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes.
932,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone’s mother."
933,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,"Really, when was the last time you left the house."
934,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,I went to the market with Penny.
935,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,That was three weeks ago.
936,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she’s going to get very crabby."
937,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Sweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you."
938,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Yes, well I’m not a child, I’m a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don’t need someone telling on me to my mother."
939,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Where are you going?
940,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"To my room, and no-one’s allowed in."
941,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,He gets his temper from his daddy.
942,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Oh.
943,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,He’s got my eyes.
944,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,I see.
945,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus."
946,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Sheldon? Your mum made dinner.
947,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,I’m not hungry.
948,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, Leonard, don’t trouble yourself, he’s stubborn. He may stay in there ‘til the Rapture."
949,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,Are we so sure that’s a bad thing?
950,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"I’ll tell ya, I love the boy to death, but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the K-Mart."
951,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Howard,"Excuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smouldering good looks."
952,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, honey that ain’t going to work, but you keep trying."
953,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"I made chicken, I hope that isn’t one of the animals that you people think is magic? You know, we have an Indian gentleman at our church, a Dr Patel, it’s a beautiful story, the lord spoke to him, and moved him to give us all 20% off on lasic, you know, those that needed it."
954,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,"That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?"
955,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, we will, you have to take your time with Sheldon. His father, God rest his soul, used to say to me, Mary, you have to take your time with Sheldon."
956,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Sounds like a wise man.
957,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, not so wise, he was trying to fight a bobcat for some licquorish. So, everybody grab a plate, and a pretty place mat that Shelly wove."
958,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.
959,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, all the time, I remember one summer when he was thirteen, he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed and told everybody he was going to provide free electricity for the whole town, well the only problem was he had no, whatchacall, fissionable materials. Anyway, when he went on the internets to get some, a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle and told him it’s against the law to have yellow cake uranium in a shed."
960,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,What happened?
961,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Well, the poor boy had a fit, locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray."
962,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,A death ray?
963,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Well, that’s what he called it, didn’t even slow down the neighbour kids. It pissed our dog off to no end. You know, you two make a cute couple."
964,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,"No, we’re not, we’re not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that…. are friends."
965,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,Did I pluck a nerve there?
966,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Howard,Oh yeah.
967,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Okay. Alright everybody, it’s time to eat."
968,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Oh Lord, we thank you for this meal, all your bounty, and we pray that you help Sheldon get back on his rocker."
969,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Now after a moment of silent meditation I’m going to end with “In Jesus’ Name” but you two don’t feel any obligation to join in. Unless, of course, the holy spirit moves you."
970,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,"Oh my God, this is the best cobbler I’ve ever had."
971,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,It was always Sheldon’ s favourite. You know what the secret ingredient is?
972,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Penny,Love?
973,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,Lard.
974,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Howard,"Hey, look who’s come out…."
975,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Shhh! You’ll spook him. He’s like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you."
976,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"You don’t hunt, do you?"
977,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Good morning, snicker-doodle."
978,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Morning.
979,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, well that looks awful fancy, what is that?"
980,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,It’s my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.
981,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"But intelligently designed by a creator, right?"
982,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"What do you want, mom?"
983,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?
984,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Yeah.
985,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Well, I’m done fishing."
986,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,You put those on.
987,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,What for?
988,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Because you’re going to go down to your office, you’re going to apologise to your boss, and get your job back."
989,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,No.
990,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"I’m sorry, did I start that sentence with the words “if it please your highness?”"
991,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"I’m not going to apologise, I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true."
992,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Now you listen here, I have been telling you since you were four years old, it’s okay to be smarter than everybody but you can’t go around pointing it out."
993,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Why not?
994,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Wouldn’t have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.
995,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,Problem solved.
996,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Really? That’s impressive.
997,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Thankfully he blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup."
998,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Excuse me, Dr Gablehouser, are you busy?"
999,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Gablehouser,"Well, actually…."
1000,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Sheldon, he’s just doodling, get in here."
1001,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Dr Gablehouser.
1002,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Gablehouser,Dr Cooper.
1003,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Let’s go, baby, we’re losing daylight."
1004,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out."
1005,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Gablehouser,"I’m sorry, we haven’t been introduced. Dr Eric Gablehouser."
1006,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Mary Cooper, Sheldon’s mom."
1007,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Gablehouser,"Now that’s impossible, you must have had him when you were a teenager."
1008,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, aren’t you sweet, his father’s dead."
1009,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Gablehouser,Recently?
1010,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,Long enough.
1011,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Gablehouser,"Please. Sheldon, shouldn’t you be working?"
1012,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Okay.
1013,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,"Hey, how did it go?"
1014,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,I got my job back.
1015,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,Really? What happened?
1016,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,I’m not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.
1017,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Leonard,That narrows it down.
1018,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,"I’m very proud of you honey, you showed a lot of courage today."
1019,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,"Thanks, mom. Mom?"
1020,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,Mmm-hmm?
1021,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Sheldon,Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?
1022,1,4,the luminous fish effect,Mrs Cooper,We’ll see. Sleep tight.
1023,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Alright, I’m moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg."
1024,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Howard,"Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla."
1025,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk."
1026,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Raj,Why don’t you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.
1027,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Hi, you guys ready to order?"
1028,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Howard,"Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?"
1029,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,And Orcs!
1030,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,I’ll be back.
1031,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Raj,"Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps."
1032,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back."
1033,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Howard,What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?
1034,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,A shower.
1035,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Howard,I’ll take the heart smart platter.
1036,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Alright, thank you, and Sheldon."
1037,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"We don’t eat here, I don’t know what’s good."
1038,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Well, it’s all good."
1039,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,Statistically unlikely.
1040,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers."
1041,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can’t make the assumption that I’ll like the hamburgers here."
1042,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,I’m sorry. Give him a hamburger.
1043,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?"
1044,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,Can’t we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy.
1045,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.
1046,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?"
1047,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,Because you are not at Big Boy!
1048,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Fine, I’ll have the Barbecue Burger."
1049,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Make it two.
1050,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,Waitresses don’t yell at you at Big Boy.
1051,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Hey Leonard, hi guys."
1052,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Hey Lesley.
1053,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,I didn’t know you ate here.
1054,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,We don’t. This is a disturbing aberration.
1055,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me."
1056,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Howard,And walks in quiet beauty like the night.
1057,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Howard, I’ve asked you not to do that."
1058,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Lesley and I do research together at the University.
1059,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Oh, wow, a girl scientist."
1060,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains. So, I’m glad I ran into you, the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist."
1061,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,What happened to Elliot Wong?
1062,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"He switched over to high energy radiation research, had a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him. So, are you in?"
1063,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Yeah, sure, why not."
1064,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place."
1065,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Why at my place?
1066,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Yeah, the department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone. Nice meeting you."
1067,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn’t know you played the cello?"
1068,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn’t getting me beaten up enough."
1069,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Howard,"If you’re into music, I happen to be a human beatbox."
1070,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,Really?
1071,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"I’m actually not that into music. So hey, your friend’s really cute, anything going on with you two."
1072,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?"
1073,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure."
1074,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Thank you Sheldon.
1075,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?"
1076,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Oh, that’s too bad, you guys would make a cute couple."
1077,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Raj,Oh dear.
1078,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Howard,What’s the matter?
1079,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Raj,She didn’t take my order.
1080,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Howard,How can she take your order when you’re too neurotic to talk to her.
1081,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Raj,"Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip."
1082,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"What did Penny mean, you’d make a cute couple?"
1083,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren’t they adorable."
1084,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"If Penny didn’t know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That’s too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available."
1085,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"You’re a lucky man, Leonard."
1086,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,How so?
1087,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,You’re talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.
1088,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Well, what do you think."
1089,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"I said I could follow it, I didn’t say I cared."
1090,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,I admire your fingering.
1091,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Thank you.
1092,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,Maybe some time you can try that on my instrument.
1093,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Goodnight guys, good job."
1094,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Male string quartettist,Thanks.
1095,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Female string quartettist,See you next week.
1096,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me."
1097,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,You’re welcome. If you’re up for it we could practise that middle section again.
1098,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Uh, sure, why not."
1099,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Just so we’re clear, you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that I’m sexually available."
1100,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Really?
1101,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Yeah, I’m good to go."
1102,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,I thought you weren’t interested in me.
1103,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.
1104,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,You mean my cello?
1105,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"No, I mean the obvious crude double entendre. I’m seducing you."
1106,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,No kidding?
1107,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"What can I say, I’m a passionate and impulsive woman. So how about it?"
1108,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Gee, uh…"
1109,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,Is it the waitress?
1110,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Penny? What about her?
1111,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Well, I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her, which, unless you’re a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction."
1112,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there’s no point in bringing it up."
1113,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,You and the waitress then?
1114,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"No. No, there’s nothing going on between Penny and me."
1115,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"So, you’re open to a sexual relationship?"
1116,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am."
1117,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,Good.
1118,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?"
1119,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,Why don’t we finish the section first.
1120,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.
1121,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"I’m good, I’m good to go."
1122,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Oh, hey Sheldon, what’s going on?"
1123,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.
1124,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,I’m sorry?
1125,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols, it’s a branch of philosophy related to linguistics."
1126,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Okay, sweetie, I know you think you’re explaining yourself, but you’re really not."
1127,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,Just come with me.
1128,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,Well?
1129,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,Well what?
1130,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,What does it mean?
1131,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Oh, come on, you went to college."
1132,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Yes, but I was eleven."
1133,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn’t want to be disturbed because they’re, you know, getting busy."
1134,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,So you’re saying Leonard has a girl in there.
1135,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Well, either that or he’s lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams."
1136,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Oh Leonard, you magnificent beast."
1137,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,We really shouldn’t be standing here.
1138,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,This is very awkward.
1139,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Oh, come on, you know, Leonard’s had girls over before, right?"
1140,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, but there’s usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse."
1141,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?"
1142,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"I didn’t have to, the dates just happened to coincide."
1143,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"So, do you know who’s in there?"
1144,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Well, there’s Leonard."
1145,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,And he’s either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930’s gangster.
1146,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night."
1147,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"No, no, wait, hold on."
1148,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,What’s the matter?
1149,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"I don’t know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?"
1150,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Gee, Sheldon, you’re asking the wrong girl. I’m usually on the other side of the tie."
1151,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Hi, Leonard. It’s me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You’re welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley."
1152,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,Big boy!
1153,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Someone touched my board. Oh God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!"
1154,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Hey, what’s the matter?"
1155,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"My equations, someone’s tampered with my equations."
1156,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Are you sure?
1157,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Of course I’m sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign’s been changed."
1158,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Oh yeah. But doesn’t that fix the problem you’ve been having?
1159,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you…. hey look, that fixes the problem I’ve been having."
1160,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,You’re welcome.
1161,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,You did this?
1162,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh?"
1163,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,Cool?
1164,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Listen, I got to hit the lab. Thanks for a great night."
1165,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Thank you, I’ll see you at work."
1166,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!"
1167,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,What?
1168,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,Who told you you could touch my board?
1169,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,No-one.
1170,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,I don’t come into your house and touch your board.
1171,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,There are no incorrect equations on my board.
1172,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Oh, that is so… so…"
1173,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate."
1174,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, she’s still going to be right."
1175,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"I’m not staring, I’m mulling."
1176,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Oh, hey Leonard."
1177,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Oh, hi."
1178,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"So, how’s it going?"
1179,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Pretty good.
1180,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Just pretty good, I’d think you were doing very good."
1181,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Pretty, very, there’s really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?"
1182,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night."
1183,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Sheldon!
1184,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,I’m coming.
1185,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"So, is it serious, do you like her?"
1186,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Wuh, I don’t…. th-th-th-that’s really two different questions, uh, I’m not…. Sheldon, we have to go!"
1187,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Boy, you’re wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse."
1188,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Alright, well, I’ll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard."
1189,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Thank you. What did she mean, she’s happy for me? Is she happy because I’m seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I’m happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person."
1190,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
1191,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"You know what, I’m being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she’s attractive, we like each other, she’s extremely intelligent."
1192,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,She’s not that intelligent.
1193,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,She fixed your equation.
1194,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,She got lucky.
1195,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,You don’t believe in luck.
1196,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,I don’t have to believe in it for her to be lucky.
1197,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I’m not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy."
1198,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,Leonard?
1199,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Yeah.
1200,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,I still don’t care.
1201,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Hey, Lesley."
1202,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Careful  Leonard, liquid nitrogen, 320 degrees below zero."
1203,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.
1204,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,Because I’ve got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn’t find a knife.
1205,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,So anyway
1206,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Hello.
1207,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Uh, what are you doing?"
1208,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
1209,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Okay, uh, what exactly do you think’s going on between us?"
1210,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"I’m not sure, but I think I’m about to discover how the banana felt."
1211,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Who wouldn’t?
1212,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can’t stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That’s where you come in."
1213,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Yeah, well, I’m just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?"
1214,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Well, I don’t know about your sex drive, but I’m probably good till New Years."
1215,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Oh. Okay. Thank you.
1216,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,Thank you!
1217,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,You want to make plans for New Years.
1218,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Lesley,"Woah, Leonard, please, you’re smothering me."
1219,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Sorry.
1220,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Howard,"Hey, look, it’s Doctor Stud!"
1221,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Doctor what?
1222,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Howard,The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music.
1223,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Wha… how did it get on the internet?
1224,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Howard,I put it there.
1225,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Well, how did you know about it?"
1226,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Raj,A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast.
1227,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Well, that part’s true!"
1228,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant."
1229,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,No kidding.
1230,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"I won’t go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger."
1231,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.
1232,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation."
1233,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Really?
1234,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can’t grow soup."
1235,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"So, how’s everything."
1236,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Terrific, you’ll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future."
1237,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Really, oh yay!"
1238,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?
1239,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Penny,"Um, I don’t know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley?"
1240,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,"Oh, to be honest, I don’t think it’s going to work out."
1241,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?
1242,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.
1243,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Leonard,Are you even listening to me?
1244,1,5,the hamburger postulate,Sheldon,"Of course I’m listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah."
1245,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Raj,"Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball."
1246,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,That was absolutely humiliating.
1247,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose."
1248,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"Yes, but you don’t have to lose to Kyle Bernstein’s Bar-Mitzvah party."
1249,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews."
1250,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command."
1251,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Sheldon, let it go."
1252,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back."
1253,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster."
1254,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"I was giving clear, concise orders."
1255,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"You hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.”"
1256,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Oh, hey guys."
1257,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Hello Penny.
1258,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,Morning ma’am.
1259,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"So, how was paintball, did you have fun?"
1260,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun."
1261,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry."
1262,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Okay, um, oh hey, I’m having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by."
1263,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,A party?
1264,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,Yeah.
1265,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,A boy-girl party?
1266,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it’ll just be a bunch of my friends, we’ll have some beer, do a little dancing…"
1267,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Dancing?
1268,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Yeah, I don’t know, Penny…"
1269,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"The thing is, we’re not…."
1270,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,We’re really more….
1271,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,No.
1272,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"But thanks, thanks for thinking of us."
1273,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Are you sure? Come on, it’s Halloween."
1274,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,A Halloween party?
1275,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"As in, costumes?"
1276,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Well, yeah."
1277,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Is there a theme?
1278,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Um, yeah, Halloween."
1279,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?"
1280,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"As usual, I’m not following."
1281,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"He’s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy…"
1282,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,Sure.
1283,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,What about comic-books?
1284,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,Fine.
1285,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Anime?
1286,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,Of course.
1287,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods…"
1288,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye."
1289,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"Gentlemen, to the sewing machines."
1290,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Oh, no."
1291,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Raj,Make way for the fastest man alive.
1292,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Raj,Oh no!
1293,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting."
1294,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"We all have other costumes, we can change."
1295,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Raj,"Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast."
1296,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"No, no, no, it’s a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo."
1297,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?"
1298,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,All,Agreed.
1299,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,I call Frodo!
1300,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,All,Damn!
1301,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Raj,"Hey. Sorry I’m late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus."
1302,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,You went with Thor?
1303,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Raj,"What? Just because I’m Indian I can’t be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That’s racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he’s not English, but he’s dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon"
1304,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Raj,"is neither sound nor light, but he’s obviously the Doppler Effect."
1305,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"I’m not Peter Pan, I’m Robin Hood."
1306,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Raj,"Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you’re dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it’s basically the same look, man."
1307,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, there’s something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party."
1308,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"I don’t care if anybody gets it, I’m going as the Doppler Effect."
1309,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"No, it’s not…"
1310,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!"
1311,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight."
1312,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?"
1313,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey."
1314,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Well, there’s nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting."
1315,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,All I’m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and… perhaps more. I don’t want to look like a dork.
1316,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I’ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver."
1317,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Oh, hey guys."
1318,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Hey, sorry we’re late."
1319,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,Late? It’s 7
1320,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,And you said the party starts at seven.
1321,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven."
1322,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,It’s 7
1323,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in."
1324,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"What, are all the girls in the bathroom?"
1325,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Probably, but in their own homes."
1326,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,So what time does the costume parade start?
1327,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,The parade?
1328,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle."
1329,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Oh, Sheldon, I’m sorry but there aren’t going to be any parades or judges or prizes."
1330,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,This party is just going to suck.
1331,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"No, come on, it’s going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that’s so cute."
1332,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Actually, Penny, he’s Rob…"
1333,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,I’m Peter Pan! And I’ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.
1334,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"No you don’t. Oh, hey, what’s Sheldon supposed to be."
1335,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Oh, he’s the Doppler Effect."
1336,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Yes. It’s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.
1337,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I’ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable."
1338,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Okay.
1339,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"See, people get it."
1340,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Raj,"Mmmm, by Odin’s beard, this is good Chex Mix."
1341,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"No thanks, peanuts, I can’t afford to swell up in these tights."
1342,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"I’m confused. If there’s no costume parade, what are we doing here?"
1343,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,We’re socialising. Meeting new people.
1344,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Telepathically?
1345,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!"
1346,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Raj,"Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry’s."
1347,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"She’s not Catwoman, she’s just a generic cat."
1348,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,And that’s the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.
1349,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it’s time for me to turn my head and cough."
1350,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Raj,What is your move?
1351,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"I’m going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she’s thinking we’re in sync, we belong together."
1352,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Where do you get this stuff?
1353,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there’s this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls."
1354,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Raj,"Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men."
1355,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"If that’s a working stethoscope, maybe you’d like to hear my heart skip a beat."
1356,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Nurse Costume Girl,No thanks.
1357,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia."
1358,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"I  want to get to know Penny’s friends, I just, I don’t know how to talk to these people."
1359,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Well, I actually might be able to help."
1360,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,How so?
1361,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will."
1362,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Go on.
1363,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “How wasted am I?” which is met with an approving chorus of “Dude.”"
1364,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Then what happens?
1365,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,That’s as far as I’ve gotten.
1366,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"This is ridiculous, I’m jumping in."
1367,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Good luck.
1368,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"No, you’re coming with me."
1369,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Oh, I hardly think so."
1370,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Come on.
1371,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Aren’t you afraid I’ll embarrass you?
1372,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Yes. But I need a wing-man.
1373,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Alright, but if we’re going to use flight metaphors I’m much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage."
1374,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Girl in Hippie Costume,"Oh, Hi!"
1375,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Hi.
1376,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Hello.
1377,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Girl,"So, what are you supposed to be?"
1378,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Me? I’ll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!
1379,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Girl,"Uh, a choo-choo train?"
1380,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!
1381,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Girl,A brain damaged choo-choo train?
1382,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Neeeeeooooowwwwww!
1383,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Girl,I still don’t get it.
1384,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,I’m the Doppler Effect.
1385,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Girl,"Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it’s very insensitive."
1386,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra?
1387,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Because I’m Frodo.
1388,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Yes, well, I’m the Doppler Effect."
1389,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Oh no.
1390,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,What?
1391,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,That’s Penny’s ex-boyfriend.
1392,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,What do you suppose he’s doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.
1393,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"If he were any bigger, he’d have moons orbiting him."
1394,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Oh, snap. So I guess we’ll be leaving now."
1395,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,You have a back-up hypothesis.
1396,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Maybe they just want to be friends.
1397,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more."
1398,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Then he and I are on equal ground.
1399,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Yes, but you’re much closer to it than he is."
1400,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners."
1401,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy."
1402,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn’t have to back down."
1403,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,True. Why don’t you text him that and see if he backs down?
1404,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,No. I’m going to assert my dominance face to face.
1405,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?"
1406,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.
1407,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?"
1408,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system."
1409,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,"What, you’re a zebra, right?"
1410,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Yet another child left behind.
1411,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,"And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?"
1412,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"No, I’m a Hobbit."
1413,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,What’s the difference?
1414,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior."
1415,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?
1416,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash."
1417,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,"Well, whatever, why don’t you go hop off on a quest, I’m talking to Penny here."
1418,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,I think we’re all talking to Penny here.
1419,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,I’m not. No offence.
1420,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,"Okay, maybe you didn’t hear me, go away."
1421,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Alright Kurt, be nice."
1422,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,"Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy."
1423,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,Kurt!
1424,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can’t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you’re driven to animalistic puffery."
1425,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,Are you calling me a puffy animal?
1426,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Of course not, no, he’s not, you’re not, right Leonard?"
1427,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"No, I said animalistic. Of course we’re all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree."
1428,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"If he understands that, you’re in trouble."
1429,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,"So what, I’m unevolved?"
1430,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,You’re in trouble.
1431,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,"You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf."
1432,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Okay, Kurt, please."
1433,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"No, Penny, it’s okay, I can handle this. I’m not a dwarf, I’m a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?"
1434,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,"Okay, now you’re starting to make me mad."
1435,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
1436,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,What?
1437,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,I think I’ve made my point.
1438,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,"Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head."
1439,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless."
1440,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"There’s not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation."
1441,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,C – O – N… frontation!
1442,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Kurt, put him down this instant."
1443,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,He started it.
1444,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"I don’t care, I’m finishing it, put him down."
1445,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Kurt,Fine. You’re one lucky little leprechaun.
1446,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,He’s a Hobbit! I’ve got your back.
1447,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Leonard, are you okay."
1448,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Yeah, no, I’m fine. It’s good, it’s a good party, thanks for having us, it’s just getting a little late so…."
1449,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming."
1450,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Happy Halloween.
1451,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,"If it’s any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place."
1452,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,What’s that?
1453,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?
1454,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,No.
1455,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Good. There there was really all I had.
1456,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Good night Sheldon.
1457,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Good night Leonard.
1458,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,Hey Leonard.
1459,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Hi Penny.
1460,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Hey, I just wanted to make sure you’re okay."
1461,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,I’m fine.
1462,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,I’m so sorry about what happened.
1463,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,It’s not your fault.
1464,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Yes it is. That’s why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that."
1465,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,So why was he at your party?
1466,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,There there.
1467,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"God, what is wrong with me."
1468,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Nothing, you’re perfect."
1469,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Gah, I’m not perfect."
1470,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Yes you are.
1471,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Penny?
1472,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,Yeah.
1473,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,How much have you had to drink tonight?
1474,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,Just…. a lot.
1475,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn’t have something to do with what’s going on here?"
1476,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"It might. Boy, you’re really smart."
1477,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Yeah, I’m a frickin’ genius."
1478,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,"Leonard, you are so great. Why can’t all guys be like you?"
1479,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,"Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn’t survive."
1480,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Penny,I should probably go.
1481,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Leonard,Probably.
1482,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?"
1483,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,He’s not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.
1484,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,"He’s not the Marvel comic story, he’s the original Norse God."
1485,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Thank you for the clarification.
1486,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Howard,I’m supposed to give him a ride home.
1487,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Sheldon,Well I’m sure he’ll be fine. He has his hammer.
1488,1,6,the middle earth paradigm,Butterfly Girl,"Wow, I have to say, you are an amazing man. You’re gentle and passionate, and my God, you are such a good listener!"
1489,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"Watch this, it’s really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter."
1490,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard’s phone,"Did you say, call Helen Boxleitner?"
1491,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.
1492,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard’s phone,"Did you say, call Temple Beth Sader."
1493,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,No.
1494,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh."
1495,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,"Oh, that’s very impressive. And a little racist."
1496,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"If we’re all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8"
1497,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,So? We’ll start now.
1498,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break."
1499,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,"We can split it two, two and two."
1500,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Oh, what fresh hell is this?"
1501,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Hey Penny, come on in."
1502,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,Hey guys.
1503,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you’ll have good luck."
1504,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"No you won’t. Uh, can I hide out here for a while."
1505,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,Sure. What’s going on.
1506,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Well, there’s this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christie, well anyway she called me up and she’s like “Hey, how’s California,” and I’m like “Awesome” ‘cos, you know, it’s not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she’s invited herself out here to stay with me."
1507,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,nan
1508,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Anyway, she got here today, and she’s just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she’s slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink."
1509,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse."
1510,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,He really needs to dial it down.
1511,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"So, if you don’t like this Christie, why are you letting her stay?"
1512,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she’s kind of family."
1513,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"You know, I apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?"
1514,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Oh, I don’t think she’s a whore."
1515,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"No, yeah she’s definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at… where’s Howard?"
1516,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you’re new in town."
1517,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,Oh good grief.
1518,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it’s 8"
1519,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Okay, fine, we’ll just play one on one until he gets back."
1520,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"One on one? We don’t play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!"
1521,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
1522,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,"Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there’s a billion more where he came from."
1523,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I’ll play."
1524,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,Great idea.
1525,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that."
1526,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,Why?
1527,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny."
1528,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Oh, what, what, what?"
1529,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story."
1530,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off?"
1531,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,Mine.
1532,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Okay, I got this, lock and load boys."
1533,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,It’s the only way we can play teams.
1534,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Ha-ha, there goes your head again."
1535,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Okay, this isn’t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who’s just respawned, you need to give them a chance to"
1536,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,now come on!
1537,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Raj, Raj, she’s got me cornered, cover me."
1538,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!"
1539,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Penny, you are on fire."
1540,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Yeah, so is Sheldon."
1541,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Okay, that’s it, I don’t know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game."
1542,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something."
1543,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,What?
1544,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,This plasma grenade.
1545,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Ha! Look, it’s raining you!"
1546,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support."
1547,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Gosh, he’s kind of a sore loser, isn’t he?"
1548,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner."
1549,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Well, it’s been fun."
1550,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime."
1551,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,Or we could just have a life.
1552,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,I guess for you that’s an option.
1553,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Good night, Leonard."
1554,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,Good night.
1555,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"As usual, nice talking to you Raj"
1556,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,What do you suppose she meant by that?
1557,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"She’s an enigma, Raj."
1558,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"And another thing, there’s a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab…"
1559,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"She’s gone, Sheldon."
1560,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,Well she could have said goodbye.
1561,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Okay, I have a problem."
1562,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"It’s called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it."
1563,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,What’s wrong?
1564,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Um, well, Howard and Christie are… kind of… hooking up in my bedroom."
1565,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,Are you sure?
1566,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they’re either having sex or Howard’s caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?"
1567,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics."
1568,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Uh, the couch is good."
1569,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment."
1570,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Let me guess, you have a problem with this."
1571,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,Where do I begin?
1572,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"It’s up to you, crazy person’s choice."
1573,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Well first, we don’t have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent I’d ask you to leave."
1574,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else?"
1575,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit."
1576,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,So?
1577,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon."
1578,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"I’m sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?"
1579,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.
1580,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay."
1581,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,Hu.. what?
1582,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"He’s engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It’s the logical fallacy of extending someone’s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and I do not appreciate it."
1583,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,I’ll get you a blanket and a pillow.
1584,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Okay, well since I’m obviously being ignored here, let’s go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom from 7 to 7"
1585,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?
1586,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,I suggest no liquids after 11pm.
1587,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,Here you go.
1588,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Hmmph, wrong."
1589,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,I’m listening.
1590,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,Your head goes on the other end.
1591,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,Why?
1592,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"It’s culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders."
1593,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,I’ll risk it.
1594,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,Hm!
1595,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,Anything else I should know.
1596,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,Yes. If you use my toothbrush I’ll jump out that window. Please don’t come to my funeral. Have a good night.
1597,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,Sorry about that.
1598,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,That’s okay.
1599,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light."
1600,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,Got it.
1601,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Well, sleep tight."
1602,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,Thanks.
1603,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally… sleep tight."
1604,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,What are you doing?
1605,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6"
1606,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,Penny’s still sleeping.
1607,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6"
1608,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don’t you just have breakfast in bed?"
1609,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother’s Day.
1610,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Uh, what time is it?"
1611,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,Almost 6
1612,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,I slept all day?
1613,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Oh, no, it’s 6"
1614,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,What the hell is your problem?
1615,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste."
1616,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"Ola, nerd-migos."
1617,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?
1618,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"Oh, yeah, sorry, I’ll have it cleaned."
1619,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"That’s okay, keep it. Where’s Christie."
1620,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt, yours reaches places that mine just won’t."
1621,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,Y-you used my loofah?
1622,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out!
1623,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,You can keep that too.
1624,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"Ah, well then we’ll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection."
1625,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,Howard?
1626,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,In here my lady.
1627,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,"Mmmm, there’s my little engine that could."
1628,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,Well there’s one beloved children’s book I’ll never read again.
1629,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,"Hi, Christie."
1630,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,Leonard.
1631,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,I’m Sheldon.
1632,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,"Right, you’re Howard’s entourage."
1633,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Uh, so Christie, what are your plans?"
1634,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,"Oh, well, Howard said he’d take me shopping in Beverley Hills."
1635,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don’t love having you, but it’s… a little crowded."
1636,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Penny, you’re always welcome to stay with us."
1637,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Oh, terrific, now we’re running a cute little B&B."
1638,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn’t Christie stay with me."
1639,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,For one thing you live with your mother.
1640,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"I do not, my mother lives with me."
1641,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Well then, it’s all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I’ll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it’s more like Doctor Why Bother."
1642,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,Sheldon you just can’t dictate…
1643,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"No more talking, everybody go."
1644,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Castle Wolowitz?"
1645,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,"What is that, like a Mexican deli?"
1646,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"I’m sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz."
1647,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,"Oh, that’s so cool. My first Jew!"
1648,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,I imagine there aren’t many kosher corn-huskers.
1649,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,"But you’re still taking me shopping, right?"
1650,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,Anything you want.
1651,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,"Okay, I’ll go pack my stuff."
1652,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,When they perfect human cloning I’m going to order twelve of those.
1653,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Howard, can’t you see she’s using you?"
1654,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!"
1655,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she’ll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things."
1656,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,Really?
1657,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,Yeah.
1658,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"Yay! If you’ll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mizvah bonds to cash."
1659,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz."
1660,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,We can’t order Chinese food without Wolowitz?
1661,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General So’s chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?"
1662,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,I see a problem.
1663,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people.
1664,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"So, we’ll just order three entrees."
1665,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling."
1666,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,We could cut it into thirds.
1667,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich."
1668,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Waiter,"Hi fellas. Oh, where’s your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?"
1669,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,He’s putting his needs ahead of the collective good.
1670,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Where he comes from, that’s punishable by death."
1671,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Waiter,I come from Sacramento.
1672,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four."
1673,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Waiter,No substitutions.
1674,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"This isn’t a substitution, it’s a reduction."
1675,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Waiter,"Okay, no reductions."
1676,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that’s twelve, we’ll each have four."
1677,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,That works.
1678,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"No, if we fill up on dumplings we’ll need to eliminate another entree."
1679,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Waiter,No eliminations.
1680,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"If we have extra, we’ll just take the leftovers home."
1681,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"And divide it how, I’m telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz."
1682,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth."
1683,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls."
1684,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,We don’t order egg rolls.
1685,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Exactly, but we’d have to if she was here."
1686,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,"Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there’s an Indian starving right here."
1687,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Here’s an idea, why don’t we just go out for Indian food."
1688,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,No.
1689,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,Uurgh.
1690,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Waiter,"You are nice boys. Tell you what I’m going to do. I’m going to bring you the four dumplings. When I’m walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know."
1691,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,I’ll know.
1692,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,How about soup?
1693,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Yeah, we can always divide soup."
1694,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,What about the won-tons?
1695,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Oh, hey guys, what’s up?"
1696,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,It’s Halo night.
1697,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,Yeah. Okay. So?
1698,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie,"
1699,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,She’s not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty.
1700,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?"
1701,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don’t think I need to tell you what an honour this is."
1702,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Oh, that’s so sweet. But I’m going out dancing with a girlfriend."
1703,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"You can’t go out, it’s Halo night."
1704,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Well, for Penny it’s dancing night."
1705,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,You go dancing every Wednesday.
1706,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,No.
1707,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,Then it’s not dancing night.
1708,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Look, why don’t I play with you guys tomorrow?"
1709,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Tonight is Halo night, it’s like talking to a wall."
1710,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem."
1711,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Sheldon, remember, we role-played this."
1712,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Yes, but you didn’t portray her as completely irrational."
1713,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck."
1714,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.
1715,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can’t, there are three of us and two of them."
1716,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,So?
1717,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"It’s the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child’s play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman."
1718,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Aaah, for God’s sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy."
1719,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"Your anger’s not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics."
1720,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"No, I’m pretty sure my anger’s with you."
1721,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,What’s happening to us? We’re falling apart.
1722,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,Who are you calling?
1723,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
1724,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.
1725,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,And this is Christie Van Der Bell.
1726,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,nan
1727,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,We can’t get to the phone right now because we’re having sex.
1728,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,You’re not going to put that on your message are you?
1729,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Sheldon, think this through, you’re going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo."
1730,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"No, I’m going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems."
1731,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"You’re right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact."
1732,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,My point.
1733,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,"I’m just saying, you can take the damned plastic off the couch once in a while."
1734,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard’s Mother,"Why, so you and Howard can hump on it?"
1735,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"Ladies, ladies, I’m sure there’s a middle ground."
1736,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie and Howard’s Mother together,Shut up Howard.
1737,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"You girl’s talk, I’m going to take my scooter out for a little spin."
1738,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,"Are you happy, you drove your own son out of the house."
1739,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard’s Mother,Why don’t you stop butting in where you don’t belong.
1740,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,What are you guys doing here?
1741,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,It’s Halo night.
1742,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard’s Mother,"He’s not a man, he’s a putz, and don’t you take that tone with me, you gold digger."
1743,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,What did you call me?
1744,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard’s Mother,"You heard me, and I’ll tell you something else, you’re barking up the wrong tree, cos as long as you’re around, Howard is out of the will."
1745,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Christie,"You know what, I got better offers, I’m out of here."
1746,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard’s Mother,"That’s right, go back to Babylon, you whore."
1747,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"So, Halo night, huh?"
1748,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,I thought she was the whore of Omaha?
1749,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,Shhh!
1750,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he’s charging his plasma rifle."
1751,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"I can’t shoot now, I’m cloaking."
1752,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"Now, Raj, kill Sheldon."
1753,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,I can’t see him.
1754,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,"That’s why the call it cloaking, dead man."
1755,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,Well then start throwing grenades.
1756,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,I’m all out.
1757,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Penny,"Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you."
1758,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"That will do, Raj, straight for the tank."
1759,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,We said no tanks.
1760,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,There are no rules in hell!
1761,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Howard,"Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack!"
1762,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"There’s a sniper, use your rocket launcher."
1763,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,"All I’ve got is a needler, and I’m all out of ammo."
1764,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Sheldon,And now you’re out of life. Why did you hit pause?
1765,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,I thought I heard something.
1766,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Raj,What?
1767,1,7,the dumpling paradox,Leonard,"No, never mind, alright, go."
1768,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"Damn you, walletnook.com."
1769,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,Problem?
1770,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"The online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable ID, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they don’t tell you the removable ID takes up one slot, it’s a nightmare."
1771,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?"
1772,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,It’s been in every wallet I’ve owned since I was five.
1773,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,Why?
1774,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,It says keep this on your person at all times.
1775,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,It’s right here under Batman’s signature.
1776,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,And this is Leonard and Sheldon’s apartment.
1777,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,Guess whose parents just got broadband.
1778,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"May I present, live from New Delhi, Dr and Mrs V. M. Koothrappali."
1779,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,Hi.
1780,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,Lift up the camera. I’m looking at his crotch.
1781,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,Sorry papa.
1782,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,"Oh, there’s much better. Hi."
1783,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,Hi!
1784,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,And over here is Sheldon.
1785,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,Hi.
1786,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,He lives with Leonard.
1787,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Mrs Koothrappali,"Oh, that’s nice. Like Haroun and Tanweer."
1788,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"No, no, not like Haroun and Tanweer."
1789,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Mrs Koothrappali,"Such sweet young men, they just adopted the cutest little Punjabi baby."
1790,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"Yeah, we’re not like Haroun and Tanweer!"
1791,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,So are you boys academics like our son?
1792,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Together,Yes.
1793,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,And your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential?
1794,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Together,Not at all.
1795,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Papa, please don’t start."
1796,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,"God, it’s just a question, he’s so sensitive."
1797,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Okay, that’s my life, that’s my friends, good to see you, say goodbye."
1798,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Together,Bye!
1799,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,"Wait, wait. Before you go we have good news. Put the computer down and gather your friends."
1800,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,What is it papa.
1801,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,Friends.
1802,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,"Is it just me, or does webchatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless."
1803,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Mrs Koothrappali,"Rajesh, do you remember Lalita Gupta?"
1804,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable.
1805,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Mrs Koothrappali,"Yes. Well, now she’s a dental student at USC, so we gave her your contact information."
1806,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,Why did you do that?
1807,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,You’re 26 years old Rajesh. We want grandchildren.
1808,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"But Papa, I’m not supposed…"
1809,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Mrs Koothrappali,Lalita’s parents approve the match.
1810,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,"If you decide on a spring wedding, we can avoid monsoon season."
1811,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,Spring wedding?
1812,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Mrs Koothrappali,"It’s up to you dear, we don’t want to meddle."
1813,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"If you don’t want to meddle, then why are you meddling."
1814,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"If I may, your parents probably don’t consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, Indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children’s lives."
1815,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,Why are you telling me about my own culture?
1816,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,You seemed confused.
1817,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Sorry, Mommy, Papa, but with all due respect I really can’t go through…"
1818,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Mrs Koothrappali,"Sorry darling, we have to go. Doogie Howser is on. Grandma, it’s Doogie time! Bye bye."
1819,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,Bye bye.
1820,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,I don’t believe it.
1821,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,"Neither do I. Doogie Howser’s been off the air for like, twenty years."
1822,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"Actually, I read somewhere that it’s one of the most popular programmes in India."
1823,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one’s children enter the medical profession.
1824,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,I bet you’re right.
1825,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,I bet they love Scrubs.
1826,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,What’s not to love?
1827,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Excuse me, hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger, what am I going to do?"
1828,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,I suggest you go through with it.
1829,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,What?
1830,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well."
1831,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,It’s the entire premise of Fiddler on the Roof.
1832,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"I’m not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show."
1833,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,"Me too. Of course, it speaks to me culturally."
1834,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"Understandable, but there’s a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity."
1835,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,Let’s not forget it’s got some really catchy tunes.
1836,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Okay, I know what I’m going to do."
1837,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,What?
1838,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,Find new friends.
1839,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,So who wants to rent Fiddler?
1840,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"No need, we have the special edition."
1841,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"Well, maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer."
1842,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"This is Dr Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the Planetarium. Yeah, well I’m sorry too, but there’s just no room for you in my wallet. Yeah, I understand, but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History and, frankly, you don’t have dinosaurs. Well I’ll miss you too, bye bye. Okay, I know you’re texting about me, and I’d really like you to stop."
1843,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Oh dear, I am rightly and truly screwed."
1844,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"Hey, I thought you were finding new friends."
1845,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"I’ve got some feelers out. In the meantime, listen to this."
1846,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,"Hi Rajesh, this is Lalita Gupta. Your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me. So I’m calling you, and, ah… call me back. Bye."
1847,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,Can you believe how pushy she is?
1848,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,So don’t call her.
1849,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"If I don’t call her, I won’t hear the end of it from my parents."
1850,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,So call her.
1851,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"How can I call her, you know I can’t talk to women."
1852,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"I’m done, anybody else?"
1853,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,Give me the phone.
1854,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,Why?
1855,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,What are you doing?
1856,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,"Don’t worry, you’ll thank me."
1857,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,"Hello Lalita, Raj Koothrappali."
1858,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,"Yes it is good to talk to you too. So, what are you wearing. Oh, not important, so, anyhow, when would you like to meet. Friday works for me. And I call you with the time and place, but in the meantime, keep it real babe."
1859,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,You may now thank me.
1860,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"For what, making me sound like a Simpsons character?"
1861,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,"Fine, next time make your own date."
1862,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,I didn’t want to make this one.
1863,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl."
1864,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Great, then we’ll get married, I won’t be able to talk to her, and we’ll spend the rest of our lives in total silence."
1865,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,Worked for my parents.
1866,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,Hi guys.
1867,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"Oh, hey."
1868,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,I need some guinea pigs.
1869,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"Okay, there’s a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours."
1870,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I’m going to get the hang of talking to you."
1871,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,His mom’s been saying that for years. What’s up?
1872,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"Well, I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift, so I need to practice making drinks."
1873,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition."
1874,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide, for example."
1875,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"So Leonard, how about it?"
1876,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"Look, Penny, we’d love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now. And besides, he doesn’t drink, so…"
1877,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"Really? Um, Raj is going through some stuff right now and he’d like to take up drinking."
1878,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"Okay, here you go, Leonard, one tequila sunrise."
1879,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you.
1880,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,Whatever you recommend.
1881,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"Uh, how about a grasshopper. I make a mean grasshopper. Okay? Good. Coming up. Sheldon, what are you going to have?"
1882,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,I’ll have a diet coke.
1883,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks."
1884,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,Fine. I’ll have a virgin cuba libre.
1885,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"That’s, um, rum and coke without the rum."
1886,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"Yes,"
1887,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,So coke.
1888,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,Yes. And would you make it diet?
1889,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,There’s a can in the fridge.
1890,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
1891,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,Then swim to Cuba.
1892,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
1893,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"Okay, Raj, here you go. Alright, who’s next?"
1894,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,I’d like to try a slippery nipple.
1895,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"Okay, you’re cut off. Anybody need a refill?"
1896,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Where did my life go, Penny? One day I’m a carefree batchelor, and the next I’m married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi."
1897,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,A… are you talking to me?
1898,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis, of course."
1899,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,It’s amazing.
1900,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist, I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what, I’m not going to let my parents control my future any longer, it’s time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam."
1901,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"Okay, sweetie, I think that’s the grasshopper talking."
1902,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,And it’s about to tell my parents that I’m not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.
1903,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"Okay, calm down, no-one can make you get married. Why don’t you just meet this girl and, see what happens."
1904,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Haven’t you been listening to me, I cannot talk to women."
1905,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,Um… Raj.
1906,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,"No, no, let’s see how long it takes him."
1907,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"Um, Raj, honey, you say you can’t talk to women but… you’ve been talking to me."
1908,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,And now we’ll never know.
1909,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"You’re right. I… I am talking to you. Hello Penny, how are you?"
1910,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,I’m fine.
1911,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. It’s a sweet green miracle."
1912,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"Okay, if you’re going to drink on this date just promise me you won’t overdo it."
1913,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?
1914,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"Yeah, that. Uh, why don’t you bring her to my restaurant when I’m tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you?"
1915,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,Okay.
1916,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"Wait a minute, what’s the plan here? Let’s say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, what’s he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?"
1917,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,Worked for my parents.
1918,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,I can’t believe I’m sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta.
1919,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,"Well, you are."
1920,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Little Lalita. That’s kind of fun to say. Little Lalita, Little Lalita, Little Lalita, you should try it."
1921,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,"No, it’s okay."
1922,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat! Do you remember?"
1923,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,"Yes, I do."
1924,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?
1925,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,"Well, I’ve been trying."
1926,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"So you’re a dental student? Hmm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers you’re still winning."
1927,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,Yay me!
1928,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,You have a drink that’ll make him less obnoxious?
1929,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,Drinks do not work that way.
1930,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,"I’d say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail."
1931,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,Sorry I’m late.
1932,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,What happened?
1933,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"Nothing, I just really didn’t want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please."
1934,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,Okay.
1935,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"In a tall glass, with a lime wedge."
1936,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"Oh, I’ll wedge it right in there."
1937,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"So, how’s Koothrappali d…. oh my Lord."
1938,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,What?
1939,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,That’s Princess Punchali.
1940,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,I’m pretty sure her name’s Lalita.
1941,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess."
1942,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,"Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card."
1943,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,It’s a children’s story.
1944,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,"Oh, no it isn’t."
1945,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. It’s about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly."
1946,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,I know the reason.
1947,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?"
1948,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?
1949,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,"Every year at Comic Con. Every day at Disneyland you can hire Snow White to come to your house. Course they prefer it if you have a kid, but…"
1950,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn’t it great, she isn’t fat any more!"
1951,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair."
1952,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,I’m sorry?
1953,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali.
1954,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,"Oh, no kidding? Oh, who is that?"
1955,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,A beloved character from an Indian folk tale.
1956,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,"Oh. Us Indian, or “come to our casino” Indian?"
1957,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,You Indian.
1958,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,Oh.
1959,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.
1960,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,Thanks. I imagine you smell very nice too.
1961,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
1962,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,"Really, so do I."
1963,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"But you’re a dentist, he’s nuts."
1964,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,"Don’t be insulting Rajesh. So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like."
1965,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"It was said that the Gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips."
1966,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,Oh my.
1967,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,Back off Sheldon.
1968,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,What?
1969,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.
1970,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,I’m not hitting on her.
1971,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,And I am not your lady.
1972,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,And you have no wrath.
1973,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.
1974,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,"Okay, let’s get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don’t need to be getting this old world crap from you."
1975,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.
1976,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Oh, screw Princess Punchali."
1977,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,"Hey, you can’t talk to me like that."
1978,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,But you’re not Princess Punchali.
1979,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded."
1980,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,"Sheldon, are you hungry?"
1981,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,I could eat.
1982,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Lalita,Let’s go.
1983,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,What just happened?
1984,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,Beats the hell out of me.
1985,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Howard,"I’ll tell you what just happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks."
1986,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Mrs Koothrappali,What are we supposed to say to Lalita’s parents?
1987,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,"I play golf with her father, I won’t be able to look at him."
1988,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa."
1989,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,"Oh, now you’re a funny man? This is not funny, Mr Funny Man."
1990,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn’t entirely Raj’s fault."
1991,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,This is a family matter Sheldon.
1992,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"No, I’m Leonard."
1993,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,"Oh, sorry, you all look alike to us."
1994,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"But he’s right, Papa, listen to him."
1995,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,You! You are the one who ruined everything!
1996,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Mrs Koothrappali,Who is it? We can’t see.
1997,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,"Turn us, turn us."
1998,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Go ahead, tell my parents why they won’t have any grandchildren."
1999,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"How would I know, do you have a low sperm count?"
2000,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,This has nothing to do with my sperm count.
2001,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Mrs Koothrappali,"You are wearing the boxers that we sent you, aren’t you Rajesh."
2002,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,Yes Mommy.
2003,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Mrs Koothrappali,Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear the tidy whities.
2004,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did."
2005,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,What did I do?
2006,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,You left with his date. Friends don’t do that to each other.
2007,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry."
2008,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,Sorry? That’s all you can say is sorry?
2009,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"Take it, Raj. It’s more than I’ve ever gotten."
2010,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,And may I point out she wouldn’t have asked me to go with her if you hadn’t been drunk and boring.
2011,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,Drunk?
2012,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"And boring, her words."
2013,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,"I knew it, he moves to America and becomes an alcoholic."
2014,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,I’m not an alcoholic.
2015,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,Then why were you drunk?
2016,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"It was just this one time, Papa, I swear."
2017,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,Are you in denial? Do we have to come over and do an intervention?
2018,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Mrs Koothrappali,Don’t embarrass him in front of his friends.
2019,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,"Alright. Carry us outside, we want to talk to you in private."
2020,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,"But Papa, please…."
2021,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,"Now, Rajesh."
2022,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Dr Koothrappali,Now listen to me….
2023,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Raj,Please wait until I get into the hall.
2024,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"Okay, well, good night."
2025,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?
2026,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Sheldon,"We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didn’t already know, and I came home."
2027,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,So you’re not going to see her again?
2028,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,I wonder who’s going to tell his parents they’re not having grandchildren.
2029,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,"I don’t believe it, what’s gotten into him?"
2030,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"Oh, maybe a couple of virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty."
2031,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Leonard,You didn’t?
2032,1,8,the grasshopper effect,Penny,"Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine."
2033,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Okay, the X10s are online."
2034,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Look at me, look at me, I’ve got goosebumps."
2035,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,Are we ready on the stereo?
2036,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,Hey guys.
2037,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,All,Hello.
2038,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,It’s a little loud.
2039,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,"No problem, turning it down."
2040,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,"San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax"
2041,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,et voila.
2042,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Okay, thanks."
2043,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did."
2044,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop."
2045,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet."
2046,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack, they’re really cheap."
2047,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"No, no, no, you don’t get it, um, Howard, enable public access."
2048,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Boy, that’s brilliant, but I’ll see you."
2049,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"No, hang on, hang on."
2050,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,See!
2051,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,No.
2052,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off."
2053,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Huh, well that’s handy. Um, here’s a question, why?"
2054,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,They found the remote controlled cars.
2055,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Well, wait, wait, what’s on top of them."
2056,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Wireless webcams, wave hello."
2057,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,"The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv."
2058,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,You may want to put on slacks.
2059,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,What?
2060,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Ew, stop it, no, leave me alone."
2061,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Who’s running the red Corvette?
2062,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,That would be me.
2063,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"You know, in the future, when we’re disembodied brains in jars, we’re going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted."
2064,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Raj,I don’t want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped.
2065,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,I’m with you. I just have to make sure if I’m a synthetic human I’d still be Jewish. I promised my mother.
2066,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Raj,I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that’s something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers.
2067,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,Not to mention you’d have to power down on Saturdays.
2068,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?"
2069,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Well, there’s always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam’s Razor would suggest that someone threw it out."
2070,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,It’s from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.
2071,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,I know. I read it before I threw it out.
2072,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Okay… if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out."
2073,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn’t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be."
2074,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,"I don’t know, Sheldon, those topical conferences on Bowes-Einstein condensates parties are legendary."
2075,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Forget the parties.
2076,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,Forget the parties? What a nerd.
2077,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Are there any other honours I’ve gotten that I don’t know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
2078,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Leonard, please don’t take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets."
2079,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Raj,Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was “yo mamma.”
2080,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,"I’ve got one, hey Leonard, your mamma’s research methodology is so flawed…."
2081,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this."
2082,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"No we don’t. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional."
2083,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Okay, let me put it this way, I’m doing it."
2084,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,You can’t. I’m the lead author.
2085,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Oh, come on. The only reason you’re the lead author is because we went alphabetically."
2086,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. You’re welcome."
2087,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis."
2088,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,It doesn’t need proving.
2089,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?
2090,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"They’re not supposed to, but they should."
2091,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Alright, I don’t care what you say, I’m going to the conference and I’m presenting our findings."
2092,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,And I forbid it.
2093,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,You forbid it?
2094,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,If I’m not taking credit for our work then nobody is.
2095,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Oh, you admit that it’s our work."
2096,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"No, once again, I’m throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome."
2097,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Ah!
2098,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,Oh no he dit’nt!
2099,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"So, how’s it going with Sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other?"
2100,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Not only is he still not talking to me, but there’s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?"
2101,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, “I know my physics, but I’m still a fun guy!”"
2102,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Oh, hey, I didn’t know they still made corduroy suits!"
2103,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"They don’t, that’s why I saved this one."
2104,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Okay, well, let’s just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these."
2105,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Is this all stuff you want me to try on?
2106,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"No, this is stuff I want you to throw out."
2107,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Oh.
2108,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Seriously, don’t even give it to charity, you won’t be helping anyone. What’s this."
2109,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Oh, that’s the bottled city of Kandor."
2110,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,Uh-huh.
2111,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman."
2112,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Oh, nice."
2113,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,It’s a lot cooler when girls aren’t looking at it.
2114,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Here, why don’t you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match."
2115,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Great, be right back."
2116,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Well, where you going, just put them on."
2117,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Here?
2118,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Oh, are you shy?"
2119,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"No, I’m not shy."
2120,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Don’t worry, I won’t look."
2121,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"I know you won’t look, why would you look, there’s nothing to see, well, not nothing…."
2122,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Sweetie, put the pants on."
2123,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Putting them on.
2124,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"So, you know, isn’t there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing."
2125,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy."
2126,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,What is this?
2127,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Oh, careful. That’s my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit."
2128,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Oh, why didn’t you wear it at Halloween?"
2129,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Because it’s not a costume, it’s a flight suit."
2130,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt."
2131,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit."
2132,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this your… your only tie?"
2133,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Ah. Technically yes, but, if you’ll notice, it’s reversible. So it works as two."
2134,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Oh, sweetie, I don’t think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?"
2135,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade.
2136,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,The… the eighth grade?
2137,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,My last growth spurt.
2138,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Okay, well, I guess we’re back to the corduroy suit."
2139,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Great.
2140,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,Yup.
2141,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"I said no, put it down."
2142,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,Hey Sheldon!
2143,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,Get anything good?
2144,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Uh, just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly."
2145,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn’t."
2146,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,It was a joke.
2147,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Yup, tip your waitresses, I’m here all week."
2148,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that I’m perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence."
2149,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Oh yeah, me too. Zip it, lock it."
2150,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,Put it in your pocket. So you and Leonard…
2151,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,Oh dear God!
2152,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Little misunderstanding, huh."
2153,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,A little misunder…. Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.
2154,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it."
2155,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,Huh.
2156,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,Well how do you feel?
2157,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,I don’t understand the question.
2158,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,Well I’m just asking if it’s difficult to be fighting with your best friend.
2159,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,Oh. I hadn’t thought about it like that. I wonder if I’ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.
2160,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,Wait… what?
2161,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,I couldn’t poop this morning.
2162,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"You should just talk to him, I’m sure you guys can work this out."
2163,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,It’s certainly preferable to my plan.
2164,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,Which was?
2165,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,A powerful laxative.
2166,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there’s no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing."
2167,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Excuse me, little idea?"
2168,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn’t really understand it but…"
2169,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Of course you didn’t, he said little idea?"
2170,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Uh, well no, no, not in… not in those words."
2171,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"In what words then, exactly"
2172,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Um, gee, the exact words aren’t written… it’s more the spirit in which it’s"
2173,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,What did he say?
2174,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,You had a lucky hunch.
2175,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, I’ve been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don’t…."
2176,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,Don’t you ever speak to me again.
2177,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Okay, I’m leaving for the conference."
2178,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,Have fun presenting my lucky hunch.
2179,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Sheldon I didn’t mean it like that.
2180,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,Then why did you say it.
2181,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"I don’t know, I wasn’t choosing my…"
2182,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,Were you trying to impress Penny?
2183,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"No, no not at all. A little bit."
2184,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,How’d that work out for you?
2185,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Leonard, ready to go?"
2186,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Libido 1, truth zero."
2187,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Okay, I’m going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together."
2188,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"And I’m telling you for the last time it’s pandering, it’s undignified and bite me."
2189,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Let’s go.
2190,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,Bye Sheldon.
2191,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,Goodbye Penny.
2192,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Oooh, one of these days, Pkshhhh!"
2193,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,There you go.
2194,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"You’re right, this side does look better."
2195,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"No, no, I didn’t say better, I said less stained."
2196,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,"I just checked the house, there’s probably twenty, twenty-five people in there."
2197,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,You’re kidding.
2198,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,Is that all?
2199,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock."
2200,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Oh, well, then good!"
2201,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"I wasn’t expecting such a crowd, I’m a little nervous."
2202,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,"It’s okay, just open with a joke, you’ll be fine."
2203,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there’s this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won’t lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum."
2204,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Right?
2205,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Oh, sorry, I’ve just, I’ve heard it before."
2206,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,"Let’s roll. Hey, nice suit."
2207,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"It’s a classic, right?"
2208,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,I really should have brought my own car.
2209,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter."
2210,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Thank you.
2211,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Are there any questions?
2212,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Voice,Yeah. What the hell was that?
2213,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Any other questions?
2214,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the lead author of this particular paper."
2215,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Thank you. And you, sir, you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park, and I saw these children on a merry-go-round, which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gasses like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero."
2216,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"I didn’t skip it, it’s just an anecdote. It’s not science."
2217,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Oh, I see, was the apple falling on Newton’s head, was that just an anecdote?"
2218,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,You are not Isaac Newton.
2219,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"No, no that’s true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple."
2220,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,You cannot possibly be that arrogant.
2221,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"You continue to underestimate me, my good man."
2222,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Look, if you weren’t happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me."
2223,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don’t need validation from lesser minds. No offence."
2224,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"Really, so why did you come?"
2225,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,Because I knew you’d screw this up.
2226,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,I didn’t screw it up.
2227,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there."
2228,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"I’ve had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn’t go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation."
2229,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,So you admit that you’re an egotist?
2230,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Yes.
2231,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he’s worse."
2232,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,You cannot blow up my head with your mind.
2233,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,Then I’ll settle for an aneurysm.
2234,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Stop it.
2235,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"You hit me. You saw him, he hit me."
2236,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,You were trying to blow up my head.
2237,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,So it was working.
2238,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"It wasn’t, it was not, you are a nutcase."
2239,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,Oh we’ll see about that
2240,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone."
2241,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,Is this usually how these physics things go?
2242,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,More often than you’d think.
2243,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Vulcan nerve pinch!
2244,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,You could have offered me a ride home.
2245,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,You’re lucky I didn’t run you over.
2246,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"I really don’t understand what you’re so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there’s just no pleasing you."
2247,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,"You’re right, I’m the problem, I’m the one that needs help."
2248,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Well that’s not much of an apology, but I’ll take it."
2249,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Excuse me. Is there anything you’d like to apologise for?
2250,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,Yes. I’m sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for.
2251,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,You won’t believe this.
2252,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Raj,Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube.
2253,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,What?
2254,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Now, who would do that?"
2255,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Leonard,Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?
2256,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Sheldon,"Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, I’m like a flamingo on Ritalin."
2257,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Penny,"Howard, would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned “Me and my Girlfriend?”"
2258,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Howard,"Uh-oh, here comes “the talk.”"
2259,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Student one,What losers.
2260,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Student one,Who’s doing that?
2261,1,9,the cooper hofstader polarization,Student two,"Someone from Pasadena, California named… “Wolowizard.”"
2262,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to Dyson’s death in Terminator 2."
2263,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?"
2264,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Skynet is kinky? I don’t know.
2265,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.
2266,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Alright, oh wait, they use it to in…"
2267,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"too late, I win."
2268,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,Let’s go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight. I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight.
2269,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,What the hell is that?
2270,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"You wanna prowl, be my night owl,"
2271,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,we’ll take my…
2272,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"Hey guys, hi! Where you going?"
2273,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,You’ll never guess what just happened.
2274,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Oh, I give up."
2275,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"I don’t guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as I’m saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot."
2276,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,What was that?
2277,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?"
2278,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn’t get it and I couldn’t figure out why?"
2279,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,I have a conclusion based on an observation.
2280,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,No you don’t. No he doesn’t.
2281,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her."
2282,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break."
2283,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"It’s not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know."
2284,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,I think I know.
2285,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,No you don’t. He doesn’t.
2286,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"It’s this Friday at eight, you guys want to come?"
2287,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Together,No.
2288,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Because…. uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium."
2289,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,I think that’s a week from Tuesday at six.
2290,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"No, it’s this Friday, at eight."
2291,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys."
2292,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,You just lied to Penny.
2293,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Yes, I did."
2294,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration."
2295,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,So?
2296,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath."
2297,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Sheldon, are you worried about your safety."
2298,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"No, I imagine if you were going to kill me you’d have done it a long time ago."
2299,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,That’s very true.
2300,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,What?
2301,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,I need to speak to you.
2302,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,It’s two o’clock in the morning
2303,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,It’s important.
2304,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,I highly doubt that. Go away.
2305,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Are you still out there?
2306,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Yes.
2307,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,What?
2308,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"You’re right, it can wait until morning."
2309,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"What, what, what, what, what?"
2310,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, you’re in no state to talk."
2311,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Sheldon, what is it?"
2312,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,I’m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.
2313,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,What was I supposed to say.
2314,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,You could have told her the truth.
2315,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,That would have hurt her feelings.
2316,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Is that a relevant factor?
2317,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Yes.
2318,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
2319,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,And what would I have said afterwards?
2320,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I’d recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain."
2321,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"I couldn’t say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can’t wait to hear you sing again."
2322,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Why?
2323,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"It’s the social protocol, it’s what you do when you have a friend who’s proud of something they really suck at."
2324,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,I was not aware of that.
2325,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Well now you are.
2326,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Oh, alright. Leonard."
2327,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Yes.
2328,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"When we played chess earlier, you were terrific and I can’t wait to play you again. Goodnight."
2329,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath.
2330,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,What?
2331,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"I was analysing our lie, and I believe we’re in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse."
2332,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,How?
2333,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Simple. If she were to log on to
2334,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,", click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire."
2335,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today."
2336,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny , Good morning"
2337,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,Do you have any idea what time it is?
2338,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It’s accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I’m saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical."
2339,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,What do you want?
2340,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Remember how Leonard told you we couldn’t come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?
2341,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,I remember symposium.
2342,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Yes, well, he lied."
2343,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"Wait, what?"
2344,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"He lied, and I’m feeling very uncomfortable about it."
2345,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,Well imagine how I’m feeling.
2346,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Hungry? Tired? I’m sorry this really isn’t my strong suit.
2347,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?"
2348,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,To help you.
2349,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"I’m sorry, I’m not seeing the help."
2350,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me."
2351,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Oh, I’m getting a bad feeling."
2352,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Hunger? Indigestion, I’m sorry I’m really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, we’re going to participate in my cousin Leopold’s drug intervention."
2353,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Your cousin Leopold?
2354,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee, remember that, it’s important."
2355,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,What’s important?
2356,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Details, Leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details."
2357,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Do you have a cousin Leopold.
2358,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"No, I made him up. I think you’d call him Lee."
2359,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"I don’t get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?"
2360,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web."
2361,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Un-unravelable?
2362,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston she’ll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com."
2363,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing."
2364,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Ah, because it’s in Long Beach, and I don’t drive."
2365,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,We’re going to Long Beach?
2366,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"No, of course not, there’s no cousin Leo, there’s no intervention, focus Leonard."
2367,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Oh, come on!"
2368,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab."
2369,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,So he goes back into rehab?
2370,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again."
2371,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,You still told her I lied.
2372,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I’m assuming is embarrassing, yes?"
2373,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,I don’t know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.
2374,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"That’s the best part, you don’t have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she’s agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force."
2375,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"So she’s expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we’re pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach?"
2376,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Un-unravelable.
2377,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Oh hey Penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great."
2378,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium.
2379,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Oh, well, thankyou."
2380,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that’s not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when… when he has a symposium to go to."
2381,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,I don’t know what to say.
2382,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Oh, okay, alright, good."
2383,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Howard,"Oh boy, group hug."
2384,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,Uh-huh!
2385,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Howard,Uh-huh?
2386,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,Uh-huh!
2387,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Howard,Okay. So what’s up?
2388,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Well, uh, Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian."
2389,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Howard,"Wait a minute, Farminfarmian is speaking and you’re Bogarding the symposium."
2390,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Howard, I’m sorry… we’re… we’re"
2391,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Howard,"No, no, you’re quark-blocking us."
2392,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,I don’t know what to say.
2393,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Howard,Wow.
2394,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Howard, listen…"
2395,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Howard,"No, it’s okay, it’s your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening."
2396,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them."
2397,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Okay, sure. I don’t see a problem with that."
2398,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"There’s no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn’t that right Leonard."
2399,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Well… I don’t know what to say.
2400,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"It’s okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm…ian"
2401,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Good for you.
2402,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"Hah, yeah! Because he didn’t want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner."
2403,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Howard,"No, I’m lost too, I think she skipped a step."
2404,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"No, look, Sheldon’s cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he’s in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family’s going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he’s such a good man."
2405,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Oh, another hug, thank you."
2406,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"Alright you guys, good luck."
2407,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Thanks Penny.
2408,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Howard,"Yeah, uh, break a leg."
2409,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Howard,"So, road trip to Long Beach."
2410,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"No, we’re not going to Long Beach."
2411,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Raj,Why not?
2412,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Because Sheldon doesn’t have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.
2413,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Raj,"Oh, too bad. I’ve always wanted to go to Long Beach."
2414,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"It’s a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it’s now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner."
2415,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Raj,Sounds fun.
2416,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Howard,I’m game.
2417,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Raj,Shotgun.
2418,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it’s iffy."
2419,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?"
2420,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not."
2421,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"No, that’s the least of our worries. I’ve been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think there’s a problem with the current version of our lie."
2422,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"What are you talking about, it’s fine, she bought it, it’s over."
2423,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Sadly, it’s not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab."
2424,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Why not?
2425,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Because Leo is a middle child.
2426,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"There is no Leo, how can you say that?"
2427,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"You didn’t read the bio, did you? He’s not just a middle child, he’s the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab."
2428,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,I’ve got a solution.
2429,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Great, what is it?"
2430,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Get out.
2431,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Fine.
2432,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"I’ve hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I’m just trying to clean up after your mess."
2433,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,We’ll talk in the morning.
2434,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Strange man,Morning.
2435,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Who are you?
2436,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Man,I am Sheldon’s cousin Leo.
2437,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo."
2438,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Man,"Au contraire. I’m 26 years old, I’m originally from"
2439,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Man,"Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world, as a result I’ve often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem."
2440,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention."
2441,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Man,"Oh, Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology."
2442,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you."
2443,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Sheldon?
2444,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, he’s a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT."
2445,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Toby,It was more of a double major actually. Theatre and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.
2446,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?"
2447,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us."
2448,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Oh…!
2449,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Toby,"Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain."
2450,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"No. We’re going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production."
2451,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Toby,"Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?"
2452,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Subtextually, of course."
2453,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Just have fun with it.
2454,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Morning Penny.
2455,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,Hi. How did the intervention go.
2456,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"Unfortunately, we weren’t able to convince him to go to rehab."
2457,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"Well, based on what you told me, I’m not surprised."
2458,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour."
2459,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"Hi Leo, how are you feeling?"
2460,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Toby,"Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?"
2461,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,No.
2462,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Toby,Then don’t ask me how I’m feeling.
2463,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Well, that’s Leo. Hey, um, why don’t you tell me about your showcase last night?"
2464,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn’t a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it."
2465,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,There were only two people there?
2466,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,By the end. Yeah.
2467,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Toby,"Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan!"
2468,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,I’m… I’m sorry.
2469,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Toby,"The Philippines. 1992. The Subic Bay Naval Station. A young boy on the cusp of manhood. His only companions mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitos. Desperate and alone he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him to a gin pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away."
2470,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Don’t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.
2471,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Toby,That’s never been proven.
2472,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,There have been studies.
2473,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Toby,Not double blind studies.
2474,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group."
2475,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let’s give them some privacy."
2476,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?"
2477,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Sounds good.
2478,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it?"
2479,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,"Gee, why wouldn’t I?"
2480,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me."
2481,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,Yeah! Funny how things work out.
2482,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Toby,And that he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide.
2483,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,Your parents made the right decision.
2484,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Toby,I cannot work like this!
2485,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Toby,"This is amazing. Just sitting on a couch, watching TV with a woman. Not being drunk, or high, or… or… wondering if you’re a dude down there."
2486,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Penny,"Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. You’re gonna do okay."
2487,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Toby,"One day at a time, Penny, one day at a time."
2488,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Leonard,How long is he going to stay here.
2489,1,10,the loobenfeld decay,Sheldon,"He’s a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying."
2490,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Checkmate.
2491,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,O-o-o-o-h! Again?
2492,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Obviously you’re not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed."
2493,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Just reset the board.
2494,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.
2495,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,Hi guys.
2496,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Hey!
2497,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,Did you get my mail.
2498,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?"
2499,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Oh, better than North Dakota!"
2500,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,I guess that joke’s only funny in Nebraska.
2501,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,From the data at hand you really can’t draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.
2502,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Boy, it’s good to be back."
2503,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,How was your family?
2504,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend."
2505,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Sick?
2506,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Here we go.
2507,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,What kind of sick?
2508,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Oh, the flu I guess."
2509,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"I don’t need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?"
2510,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,Maybe Friday.
2511,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Friday, was that morning or afternoon?"
2512,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,I… I don’t…
2513,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Think woman, who blew their nose and when?"
2514,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Sheldon, relax, she doesn’t have any symptoms, I’m sure she’s not contagious."
2515,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose."
2516,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Penny, you’ll have to excuse Sheldon, he’s a bit of a germophobe."
2517,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Oh, it’s okay, I understand."
2518,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Thanks for your consideration, now please leave."
2519,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,You’d better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.
2520,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail."
2521,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,What?
2522,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,What the hell are you doing?
2523,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,I’m making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures.
2524,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,With lime jello?
2525,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat."
2526,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,I don’t think so.
2527,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Leonard! If I’m going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what’s growing in my throat.
2528,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not."
2529,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I’m fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies.
2530,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Sheldon, don’t you think you’re overreacting?"
2531,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"When I’m lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance."
2532,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,I’m going back to bed.
2533,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Wait.
2534,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Put this in the bathroom.
2535,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,What for?
2536,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren’t shutting down.
2537,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,I mix pancake batter in this!
2538,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"No, that measuring cup has always been for urine."
2539,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn’t have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup?"
2540,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,It’s right here on the bottom.
2541,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology.
2542,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Oh, dear God."
2543,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Leonard! Leonard, I’m sick!"
2544,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Leonard! Leonard I’m sick!
2545,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Leonard! Leonard! Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over. Leonard?"
2546,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Ow!
2547,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Hey.
2548,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Leonard, where are you?"
2549,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,I’m at work.
2550,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,At six-thirty in the morning?
2551,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Yes.
2552,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,On Sunday?
2553,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Yes.
2554,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Why?
2555,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,They asked me to come in.
2556,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Well, I didn’t hear the phone ring."
2557,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,They texted me.
2558,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate."
2559,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,No kidding?
2560,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green."
2561,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids."
2562,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?
2563,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Drink whatever you want.
2564,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,I want soup.
2565,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Then make soup.
2566,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,We don’t have soup.
2567,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Is that a dog?
2568,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Yes,"
2569,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,In the lab?
2570,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Yes, they’re training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go."
2571,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard’s Mother,"Howard, it’s the phone."
2572,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"I know it’s the phone, Ma, I hear the phone."
2573,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard’s Mother,Well who’s calling at this ungodly hour?
2574,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,I don’t know.
2575,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard’s Mother,Well ask them why they’re calling at this ungodly hour.
2576,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,How can I ask them when I’m talking to you!
2577,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,Hello.
2578,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Howard, it’s Leonard, code Milky Green."
2579,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"Dear Lord, not Milky Green!"
2580,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Affirmative, with fever."
2581,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard’s Mother,Who’s on the phone.
2582,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,It’s Leonard.
2583,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard’s Mother,Why is he calling.
2584,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,Sheldon’s sick.
2585,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard’s Mother,Were you playing with him?
2586,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"For God’s sake, Ma, I’m twenty six years old."
2587,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard’s Mother,Excuse me Mr Grown-up. Whadda-ya want for breakfast.
2588,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,Chocolate milk and eggoes please!
2589,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Howard, listen to me."
2590,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"Hang on, call waiting."
2591,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"No, don’t, don’t…."
2592,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,Hello.
2593,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Howard, I’m sick."
2594,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"Howard’s sleeping, this is his mother. Why are you calling at this ungodly hour?"
2595,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,I need soup.
2596,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,Then call your own mother.
2597,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,It was Sheldon.
2598,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,I tried to stop you.
2599,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"It’s my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of ’06."
2600,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours."
2601,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?"
2602,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard’s Mother,I just had the carpets steamed.
2603,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,That’s a negatory. But there’s a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today.
2604,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Five movies, two hours apiece. It’s a start."
2605,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Waitress,Homeless crazy guy at table eighteen.
2606,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
2607,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"I’m sick, thank you very much."
2608,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"How could you have gotten it from me, I’m not sick."
2609,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,You’re a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You’re doomed!
2610,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want."
2611,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,I want soup.
2612,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,Why didn’t you just….
2613,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,Why didn’t you just have soup at home.
2614,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don’t you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?"
2615,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,You can have soup delivered.
2616,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for."
2617,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Okay, what kind of soup do you want."
2618,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons."
2619,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.
2620,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?
2621,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,No.
2622,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Then surprise me.
2623,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Would you call that moss green or forest green?
2624,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"Look at this, everyone went chimp."
2625,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Oh, hi Penny!"
2626,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Hey, where are you?"
2627,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,I’m… uh… at work.
2628,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,You sound funny.
2629,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,I’m… uh… in a… I’m in a radiation suit. What’s up?
2630,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Yeah, well I’m at work too, and you’ll never guess who’s here infecting my entire station."
2631,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Sheldon’s at the Cheesecake Factory.
2632,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Just tell him to go home.
2633,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"He won’t leave, he says he’s afraid he’ll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs."
2634,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,Can you please come get him?
2635,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, I’d be… I’d be happy to Penny."
2636,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Oh my God there’s a breech in the radiation unit
2637,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"The whole city is in jeopardy, oh my God, Professor Googenfeil is melting, gotta go, bye!"
2638,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,I feel really guilty.
2639,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,Take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape.
2640,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Thanks for bringing me home.
2641,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Oh, it’s okay, I didn’t really need to work today, it’s not like I have rent or car payments or anything."
2642,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Good. Good.
2643,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Okay, well, you feel better."
2644,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Wait, where are you going?"
2645,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Um, home, to write some bad cheques."
2646,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,You’re going to leave me?
2647,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven’t you ever been sick before?"
2648,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Well, of course, but, not by myself."
2649,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Really, never?"
2650,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany."
2651,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,Studying abroad?
2652,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I’m used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia."
2653,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,And there was no-one there to take care of you?
2654,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"No. No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again."
2655,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,Again?
2656,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn’t speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said “"
2657,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,What does that mean?
2658,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Based on what happened next, I assume it means “would you like an enema?”"
2659,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Okay, sweetie, I’ll take care of you, what do you need?"
2660,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths."
2661,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas."
2662,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Agreed.
2663,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Raj,"Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness."
2664,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I’m blind here guys, can you help me find them?"
2665,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,Sorry.
2666,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,Found ‘em.
2667,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Oh great.
2668,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"Sorry, don’t you have a spare."
2669,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Yeah, at home."
2670,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Raj,"Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston."
2671,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"Unless Sheldon’s there, in which case you’ll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web."
2672,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Hi, Penny. I was wondering, is Sheldon still at the restaurant? Okay, that was very nice of you. Okay, gotta go, got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here, gotta go, bye."
2673,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"He’s home, I’m screwed. Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness."
2674,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Raj,How about Lasic?
2675,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,You want me to get eye surgery?
2676,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Raj,"Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?"
2677,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,Well?
2678,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,I’m thinking!
2679,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I’ll see you later."
2680,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.
2681,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Oh, Sheldon, can’t you do that yourself?"
2682,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.
2683,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,But Sheldon….
2684,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
2685,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,I can’t believe I’m doing this.
2686,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats."
2687,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,Sorry.
2688,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Can you sing “Soft Kitty”.
2689,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,What?
2690,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.
2691,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"I’m sorry, honey, I don’t know it."
2692,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"I’ll teach you. “Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.” Now you."
2693,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty…"
2694,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.
2695,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,Little ball of fur.
2696,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"What do you see, what do you see."
2697,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Raj,The living room appears to be empty.
2698,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal."
2699,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,I’m not going in there.
2700,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Raj?
2701,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Raj,"No way, Jose."
2702,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Well I can’t do it, I can’t see anything."
2703,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"It’s all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. We’ll be your eyes."
2704,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Fine.
2705,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you’ll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses."
2706,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Won’t my footsteps set it off?
2707,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"No, you’ll be on your hands and knees. Now you’ll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon’s room."
2708,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Well, how do I carry it if I’m on my hands and knees?"
2709,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,Stay low. Bear left. Now keep true.
2710,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,What?
2711,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,It means go straight.
2712,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Then just say go straight.
2713,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"You don’t stay go straight when you’re giving bearings, you say keep true."
2714,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Alright
2715,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,I just hit my head.
2716,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,Because you didn’t keep true.
2717,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"Okay, turn right."
2718,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Raj,The… the picture’s breaking up.
2719,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,Angle your head to the right. A little more. A little more.
2720,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"That’s it, now just keep true. Alright, you’re close enough to Sheldon’s room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on."
2721,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,It wasn’t on?
2722,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,No.
2723,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Then why did I have to crawl?
2724,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,"Oh, I guess you didn’t."
2725,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Okay, it’s on."
2726,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl.
2727,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,I know.
2728,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,You rat bastard.
2729,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Howard,Told you the sensor would work.
2730,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,Hi!
2731,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.
2732,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Well, I had to, you see what he’s like."
2733,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Penny! Penny, I’m hungry."
2734,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Uh, it’s okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard’s home!"
2735,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,No!
2736,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Penny,"Here you go, good luck, bye."
2737,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,W-wait!
2738,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m hungry!"
2739,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,I want grilled cheese.
2740,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?
2741,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,I don’t think Penny’s ever coming here again.
2742,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,I’m very congested.
2743,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"Yeah, so?"
2744,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus."
2745,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Leonard,"If I stand, I’ll vomit."
2746,1,11,the pancacke batter anomaly,Sheldon,"Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl."
2747,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Here’s the problem with teleportation.
2748,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Lay it on me.
2749,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another."
2750,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,How about that.
2751,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon."
2752,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?
2753,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"No, he would be exactly the same."
2754,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,That is a problem.
2755,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"So, you see it too."
2756,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dr Gablehouser,"Dr Hofstadter, Dr Cooper."
2757,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Together,Dr Gablehouser.
2758,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,"Gentlemen, I’d like you to meet Dennis Kim. Dennis is a highly sought after Doctorial candidate and we’re hoping to have him do his graduate work here."
2759,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Graduate work, very impressive."
2760,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,And he’s only fifteen years old.
2761,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen."
2762,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,"Well, I lost a year while my family was tunnelling out of North Korea."
2763,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Advantage Kim.
2764,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,"I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why we’re the best physics research facility in the country."
2765,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,"I already know you’re not. You don’t have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end."
2766,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end."
2767,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,"Well, obviously you don’t see it yet, but trust me, you will."
2768,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,"Dennis, we discussed this, we’re in the process of updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our research goals, and we’ve agreed to look the other way if you want to use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang. We want him here boys, make it happen."
2769,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Yes sir.
2770,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"You can count on us, we’re on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end."
2771,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,"I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In addition… ooh, look, chocolate milk."
2772,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,I sense a disturbance in the force.
2773,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm."
2774,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"So, Dennis, how long have you been in America."
2775,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,A year and a half.
2776,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"No kidding, you speak English really well."
2777,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,So do you. Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions.
2778,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,What are you talking about?
2779,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,That.
2780,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"He’s not wrong. Alright, and this is my office."
2781,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,Is this part of the tour?
2782,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Nope. Goodbye.
2783,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon, we’ve hardly shown him anything."
2784,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye."
2785,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,Looks like you’re doing work in quantum loop corrections.
2786,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Keen observation, goodbye."
2787,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,"You see where you went wrong, don’t you?"
2788,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Leonard.
2789,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Huh, yeah?"
2790,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Get him out.
2791,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the rec centre, they’ve got nautilus equipment."
2792,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,Do I look like I lift weights.
2793,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Not heavy ones.
2794,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,It’s startling to me you haven’t considered a Lorentz invariant field theory approach.
2795,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,You think I haven’t considered it? You really think I haven’t considered it?
2796,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,Have you considered it?
2797,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Get him out Leonard.
2798,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the radiation lab."
2799,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,"Wow, you won the Stephenson award."
2800,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it."
2801,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,"Really, how old?"
2802,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Fourteen and a half.
2803,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,You were the youngest person ever to win it.
2804,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"It’s like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn’t it?"
2805,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Penny,"Mmm, this is really delicious, isn’t it?"
2806,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Penny,"Still can’t talk to me unless you’re drunk, huh?"
2807,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Penny,"Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged."
2808,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"Hey, I’m damaged too. How about a hug for Howie?"
2809,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Penny,"Sure. Raj, hug Howard."
2810,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Uh-uh-uh.
2811,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Something you’d like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.
2812,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and he’s already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to… you know, that other guy."
2813,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,Antonio Salieri?
2814,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Oh, God, now even you’re smarter than me."
2815,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"You know, Sheldon, you don’t have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them."
2816,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Just eat, Sheldon, you’ll feel better."
2817,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don’t keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes."
2818,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Penny,"I’m confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk?"
2819,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,You can’t let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.
2820,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg."
2821,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Penny,"So, you’ve got a bit of competition, I really don’t see what the big deal is."
2822,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Well of course you don’t, you’ve never excelled at anything."
2823,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Penny,"I don’t understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?"
2824,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,We liked Leonard.
2825,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?"
2826,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Yes. That’s what a rational person does when his entire life’s work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die."
2827,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Penny,"You know, I’m confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?"
2828,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Hey.
2829,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Hey.
2830,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,I’ve decided you’re right. My career is not over.
2831,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Great.
2832,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on."
2833,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Great.
2834,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"So I’ve decided, I’m going to collaborate with you."
2835,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Great.
2836,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I’ve never really paid attention."
2837,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Okay, well, right now I’m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don’t need any help."
2838,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what’s this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?"
2839,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Yes.
2840,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?
2841,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,It would blow up.
2842,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Are you sure?
2843,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Pretty sure.
2844,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Pretty sure’s not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?"
2845,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you’re going through a bit of a career crisis, you’re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully."
2846,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Alright.
2847,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Go away.
2848,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"If you’re concerned about sharing credit with me, you’re name can go first… I’m going."
2849,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"It’s a small brown paper bag, Ma, I’m looking at it right now."
2850,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"Why would I make that up, there’s no ding-dong in it."
2851,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today?
2852,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"So, this is engineering, huh?"
2853,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,I’ll talk to you later.
2854,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science."
2855,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
2856,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,I just came by to say hello.
2857,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"I’ve been at this lab for three years, you’ve never came by to say hello."
2858,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Well, up until now I’ve had better things to do. So, what are we making today?"
2859,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that’s going up on the next space shuttle.
2860,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Really, how does it work?"
2861,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it."
2862,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Uh, huh. So it’s a shelf?"
2863,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"No, you don’t understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide… yeah, okay, it’s a shelf."
2864,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Now, I notice you’re using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they’re lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength."
2865,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"Sheldon, there’s a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering."
2866,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes."
2867,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,Sheldon.
2868,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Yes.
2869,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,Go away.
2870,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Did Leonard tell you to say that?
2871,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"No, I thought of it all by myself."
2872,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Huh. It can’t be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I’m missing.
2873,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Curiouser and curiouser.
2874,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,Is he here?
2875,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"If he were, I wouldn’t be."
2876,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,"Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me."
2877,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Is that even possible?
2878,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,"As it turns out, yes."
2879,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"Something’s got to be done about him, Leonard."
2880,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Like what? He’ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is.
2881,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,"Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?"
2882,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,Then our problem would be solved.
2883,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I’m not saying no."
2884,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"We don’t have to go that far, there are other means available."
2885,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,We can’t send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out.
2886,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.
2887,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"That won’t happen, he’s not interested in anything but physics."
2888,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,What about biology?
2889,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,What?
2890,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind."
2891,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Howard, he’s fifteen."
2892,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8."
2893,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,She was sleeping with you?
2894,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did."
2895,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Oh, good, you’re all here. Look, I’ve decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you’re working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade, twelve years tops."
2896,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Go away?
2897,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Hmm. Could it be me?
2898,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Penny,"Oh, hey guys, what’s up?"
2899,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys.
2900,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Penny,What?
2901,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,It’s possible she may have misunderstood us.
2902,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,"Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?"
2903,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you’ll appreciate this, very exciting."
2904,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,"Oh, what are you working on?"
2905,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I’ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I’m going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert."
2906,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,To what end?
2907,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"You know, it’s like the baseball movie, build it and they will come."
2908,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,Who will come?
2909,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,The Jewish people.
2910,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,What if they don’t come.
2911,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"We’ll make it nice, put out a spread."
2912,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,"Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we’re having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who’s agreed to join us here at the University."
2913,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can’t you."
2914,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,"Okay, well, uh, obviously you’re very busy with your… uh, um, come Dennis. You’ll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he’s been under a lot of… um… he’s nuts."
2915,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"I really don’t understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn’t the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?"
2916,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Goldfarb,Go away.
2917,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem.
2918,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Goldfarb,Please go away.
2919,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Said Pharoah to Moses.
2920,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,Why are all these young women here?
2921,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,It’s take your daughter to work day.
2922,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,"Really, I was not aware of that."
2923,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,"Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16."
2924,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,Hm?
2925,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,Smooth.
2926,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,Thank you.
2927,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,There’s the man of the hour.
2928,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women."
2929,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
2930,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,We need a social catalyst.
2931,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,Or can we?
2932,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"No, we can’t."
2933,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,I don’t think you mean we can’t. I think you mean we shouldn’t.
2934,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Hey, Howard. You’re a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it’s definitely me."
2935,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis."
2936,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,Okay. How about that one.
2937,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won’t even look at anybody in the gifted programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you’re in the back seat of your mom’s car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you."
2938,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,Are you crying?
2939,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"No, I have allergies."
2940,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,"Okay, uh, how about her?"
2941,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you’re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she’s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn’t even know you."
2942,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,"Okay, so not her either. How about her?"
2943,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem."
2944,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,I think that’s our girl. One of us should go talk to her.
2945,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,"I can’t talk to her, you do it."
2946,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"I can’t just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her."
2947,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"Oh no, she’ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this."
2948,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,"You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we’d be done."
2949,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Well, we’re not in India."
2950,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,"Alright, why don’t we do it your way then? We’ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end."
2951,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Okay, that was uncalled for."
2952,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,"You started it, dude."
2953,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,Could I have everyone’s attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We’re here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.
2954,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Welcome Dennis Kim.
2955,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,"Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stephenson Award."
2956,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!
2957,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,"And now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr Dennis Kim. Dennis! Dennis!"
2958,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,What?
2959,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research.
2960,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Dennis,"Um, no thanks. I’m going to the mall with Emma."
2961,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Gablehouser,"Well, uh, well, uh…."
2962,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,The kid got a girl.
2963,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,Unbelievable.
2964,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,Did anyone see how he did it?
2965,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Don’t worry, I’ve got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you."
2966,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,He’s back.
2967,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Yeah, mission accomplished."
2968,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,"Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?"
2969,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy.
2970,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Well, why do we go home alone every night, we’re still smart."
2971,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,Maybe we’re too smart. So smart it’s offputting.
2972,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"Yeah, let’s go with that."
2973,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park."
2974,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"I don’t know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman “you have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.”"
2975,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,"Hey, look at that."
2976,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Raj,It’s Dennis Kim.
2977,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Howard,"Wow, I almost didn’t recognise him."
2978,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Leonard,"Yeah, we really ruined his life."
2979,1,12,the jerusalem duality,Sheldon,"Screw him, he was weak."
2980,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,"Ooh, more details about the new Star Trek film. There’s going to be a scene depicting Spock’s birth."
2981,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,I’d be more interested in a scene depicting Spock’s conception.
2982,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it’s an extremely private matter."
2983,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Still, I’d like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn’t just conceive."
2984,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock’s dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.
2985,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,"How come on Star Trek everybody’s private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose."
2986,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck. Now it’s just going “aaaaaaa”."
2987,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,What did you spill on it?
2988,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish.
2989,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,I’ll take a look at it.
2990,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,"Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren’t fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year."
2991,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"You’re kidding, why not?"
2992,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,"They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsbury Farm."
2993,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"Wow, so in your world, you’re like, the cool guys."
2994,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,Recognise.
2995,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod."
2996,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,Zod?
2997,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,Kryptonian villain. Long story.
2998,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Well count me out.
2999,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,What? Why?
3000,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?
3001,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Come on, you need a four person team, we’re four people."
3002,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition."
3003,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,I want tickets to that please.
3004,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock’s dying words to you."
3005,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"No, don’t."
3006,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,The needs of the many.
3007,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,Outweigh the needs of the few.
3008,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Or the one. Dammit, I’ll do it."
3009,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.
3010,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,"How about the perpetual motion squad? It’s beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies."
3011,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,The ladies?
3012,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,"Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night."
3013,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,I like it.
3014,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"I don’t. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent."
3015,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.
3016,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant."
3017,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,Maybe so. But you can’t incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass.
3018,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,Let’s put it to a vote. All those in favour….
3019,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant."
3020,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question?
3021,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,I will yield.
3022,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?"
3023,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,He does.
3024,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?"
3025,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s physics bowl practice round. I’m Penny, and I’ll be your host, because apparently I didn’t have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn’t that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?"
3026,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,Yes.
3027,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Of course.
3028,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"You know, it’s none of my business, but isn’t a guy who can’t speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?"
3029,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Oh, uh, he’ll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they’re one on one and smell nice."
3030,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"Oh, thanks Raj, it’s vanilla oil."
3031,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let’s just start."
3032,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper."
3033,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds."
3034,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,That is correct.
3035,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,I knew that too.
3036,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard."
3037,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance."
3038,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,Right.
3039,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,"Hey, I buzzed in."
3040,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"But I answered, it’s called teamwork."
3041,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,Don’t you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.
3042,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,Just ask another one.
3043,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,And of course it’s Gravity Probe B.
3044,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer."
3045,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Why?
3046,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,Because it’s polite.
3047,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
3048,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions."
3049,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn’t I give them?"
3050,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,Some of us might have the correct answers too.
3051,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Oh please, you don’t even have a PhD."
3052,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,"Alright, that’s it."
3053,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Howard, sit down."
3054,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,Okay.
3055,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,maybe we should take a little break.
3056,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury."
3057,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,I agree.
3058,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,What did he say?
3059,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer’s eve.
3060,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"Yeah, and the bag it came in."
3061,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something."
3062,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Can it wait, I need to talk to you."
3063,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Just look. I’ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold."
3064,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,Why do they say AA?
3065,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Army Ants.
3066,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,Isn’t that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people.
3067,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?
3068,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"No, I meant…. never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!"
3069,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Oh neat, what’s the occasion?"
3070,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Well, you’re a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you’re off the team."
3071,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,What?
3072,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting."
3073,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,No you didn’t.
3074,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Yes we did, I just came from it."
3075,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Okay, I don’t know where you just came from, but it couldn’t have been a team meeting because I’m on the team and I wasn’t there, ergo the team did not meet."
3076,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you’re off the team."
3077,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Why?
3078,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,Because you’re taking all the fun out of it.
3079,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Well, I’m sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?"
3080,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Okay, let me try it this way, you’re annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more."
3081,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears."
3082,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,Thanks for the heads up.
3083,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,You’re welcome. One more thing.
3084,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,Yes.
3085,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"It’s on, bitch."
3086,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,So who’d he get to be on his team.
3087,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"He won’t say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar."
3088,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,"He’s using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you."
3089,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,How exactly would that laugh go?
3090,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
3091,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,"That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians."
3092,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Guys, let’s remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate."
3093,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,So?
3094,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"So nothing, let’s destroy him."
3095,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Gentlemen.
3096,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
3097,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,"Okay, we’re going to need a strong fourth for our team."
3098,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,"You know who’s apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV’s Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something."
3099,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Raj, we’re not getting TV’s Blossom to join our physics bowl team."
3100,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,How about the girl from the Wonder Years?
3101,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,"Gentlemen, I believe I’ve found the solution to all our problems."
3102,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,We can’t ask Leslie Winkle.
3103,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night’s chutney?
3104,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,Yes.
3105,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,Sometimes you’ve got to take one for the team.
3106,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,"Yeah. Sack up, dude."
3107,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie."
3108,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,Hi guys.
3109,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I…"
3110,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,Hit that thang.
3111,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,"Leonard, there’s no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we’ve seen each other’s faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus."
3112,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"There’s not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be."
3113,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,"Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom."
3114,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"That’s all very comforting, but if it’s okay, I’d like to get on with my question now."
3115,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,Proceed.
3116,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.
3117,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,"No thanks, I’m really busy with my like sign dilepton super symmetry search."
3118,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,"Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you."
3119,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,Sorry.
3120,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,"Well, we tried. Just have to face Sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano."
3121,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,"Wait, you’re going up against Sheldon Cooper?"
3122,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,Yes.
3123,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,"That arrogant, misogynistic East-Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high energy particles for laundry and child bearing?"
3124,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,She’s in.
3125,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"So, how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on?"
3126,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,Are you ready?
3127,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Oh, yeah. You know you don’t have to stay for the whole thing."
3128,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting."
3129,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Gentlemen.
3130,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,Sheldon.
3131,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,Sheldon.
3132,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.
3133,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,Sheldon. I’m just going to sit down.
3134,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"So, is that your team."
3135,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Actually, I don’t need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?"
3136,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,"Hello, Sheldon."
3137,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Leslie Winkle?
3138,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,"Yeah, Leslie Winkle. The answer to the question, who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl?"
3139,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Yes, well, I’m polymerised tree sap and you’re non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you."
3140,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,"Oh, ouch."
3141,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Dr Gablehouser,"Okay, if everyone could please take your seats."
3142,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,"PMS? It’s a couple of days early, but…"
3143,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad."
3144,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,"Oh, right, of course, what was I thinking?"
3145,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,"Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to this year’s physics bowl. Today’s preliminary match features two great teams… AA versus PMS."
3146,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,"Okay, well let’s jump right in, first question, for ten points. What is the isospan singlet partner of the Pi Zero Meson?"
3147,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,PMS?
3148,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,The Eta Meson.
3149,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,Correct.
3150,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Formal protest.
3151,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,On what grounds?
3152,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.
3153,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,"Denied. Alright, for ten points, what is the lightest element on earth with no stable isotope."
3154,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"And of course, the answer is Technetium."
3155,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,"Terrific. Next question, what is the force between two uncharged plates due to quantum vacuum fluctuation."
3156,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,PMS?
3157,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,"Sheldon can suck on, the Casimir Effect."
3158,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,Correct.
3159,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,How does a quantum computer factor large numbers.
3160,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,PMS?
3161,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,Shor’s Algorithm.
3162,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,Correct.
3163,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,Prevost’s theory of exchanges.
3164,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Lamda equals one over Pi R squared N
3165,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,"760 degrees celsius, the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row."
3166,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,"Mr Wolowitz, this is your second warning."
3167,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,A sigma particle.
3168,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,"Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the earth."
3169,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,"Correct. Ladies and gentlemen, I hold in my hand the final question. The score now stands AA 1150, PMS 1175. So, for one hundred points, and the match, please turn your attention to the formula on the screens. Solve the equation."
3170,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Raj,Holy crap.
3171,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,What the hell is that.
3172,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,It looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell.
3173,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Come on, think, Leslie."
3174,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leslie,"Leonard, it’s not going to work if you rush me, you have to let me get there."
3175,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"You’re never going to let that go, are you?"
3176,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,Ten seconds.
3177,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,PMS.
3178,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Sorry, I panicked."
3179,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,Then guess.
3180,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,"I’m sorry, that’s incorrect. AA, if you can answer correctly, the match is yours."
3181,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Howard,He doesn’t have it. He’s got squat.
3182,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Third Floor Janitor,The answer is minus eight by alpha.
3183,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Hang on, hang on a second, that’s not our answer. What are you doing?"
3184,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Third Floor Janitor,Answering question. Winning physics bowl.
3185,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,How do you know anything about physics?
3186,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Third Floor Janitor,"Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Politechnica. Go Polar Bears."
3187,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Well that’s a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions."
3188,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Third Floor Janitor,You didn’t answer question.
3189,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist."
3190,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Ow!
3191,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,"AA, I need your official answer."
3192,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Well it’s not what he said.
3193,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,Then what is it?
3194,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,I want a different question.
3195,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,You can’t have a different question.
3196,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Formal protest.
3197,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,Denied.
3198,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Informal protest.
3199,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,Denied. I need your official answer.
3200,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,No. I decline to provide one.
3201,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,"Well, that’s too bad, because the answer your teammate gave was correct."
3202,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,That’s your opinion.
3203,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,"Alright, the winner of the match is…"
3204,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team."
3205,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,I don’t understand the question.
3206,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,Go ahead.
3207,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Gablehouser,The winner is PMS!
3208,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Sorry, somebody’s sitting there."
3209,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Who?
3210,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,My Physics Bowl Trophy!
3211,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,"That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win."
3212,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,I know someone who would disagree.
3213,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Who?
3214,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,My Physics Bowl Trophy!
3215,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"“Leonard is so smart, Sheldon who?”"
3216,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Alright that is very immature.
3217,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"You’re right, I’m sorry."
3218,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,I’m not!
3219,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"Okay, new contest."
3220,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,What are you doing?
3221,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"I’m settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. Okay, are you ready?"
3222,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Absolutely.
3223,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,Bring it on.
3224,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"Okay. Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters of what TV family?"
3225,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"The Brady Bunch. Okay, Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?"
3226,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,The Brady Bunch?
3227,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"Van Halen. Alright, Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum."
3228,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"Oh my God, Sean Penn!"
3229,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,How do you know these things?
3230,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"I go outside and I talk to people. Alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazine’s sexiest man alive?"
3231,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,William Shatner.
3232,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Leonard,"Wait, I don’t think it’s Shatner."
3233,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Then it’s got to be Patrick Stewart.
3234,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,No.
3235,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Formal protest.
3236,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"Alright, singer who sang “Oops I Did It Again.”"
3237,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,"Okay, Tweetie Bird, taught he taw a what?"
3238,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Sheldon,Romulan.
3239,1,13,the bat jar conjunction,Penny,Yes. He taught he taw a Romulan.
3240,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat."
3241,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,What did they give you?
3242,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It’s the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.
3243,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,I don’t believe it.
3244,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"I know, it’s basic culinary science."
3245,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it.
3246,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,A time machine from the movie The Time Machine?
3247,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"No, a time machine from Sophie’s Choice."
3248,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, it’s rough."
3249,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,"Oh, that’s cool."
3250,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Uh-huh.
3251,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,It’s only $800?
3252,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Yeah. And that’s my bid.
3253,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,You bid $800.
3254,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it."
3255,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,There’s only 30 seconds left in the auction.
3256,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,Do you have $800?
3257,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Not to blow on a miniature time machine.
3258,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,"Don’t worry, the way these things work there’s people waiting ‘til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, it’s called sniping."
3259,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,Fifteen seconds.
3260,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Come on, snipers."
3261,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"Ten, nine, eight…"
3262,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Where are your snipers?
3263,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,Five.
3264,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Snipe.
3265,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,Four.
3266,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Snipe.
3267,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,Three.
3268,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Snipe!
3269,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,Two.
3270,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,SNIPE!
3271,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,One.
3272,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Aaaa-aw!
3273,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine."
3274,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,You lucky duck.
3275,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia."
3276,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Yeah, I know, I still can’t afford it."
3277,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,Why don’t we share it? We’ll each put in two hundred bucks and we’ll take turns having it in our homes.
3278,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,A time share time machine? I’m in. Sheldon?
3279,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,Need you ask? But I still don’t understand why no-one else bid.
3280,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,I understand why no-one else bid.
3281,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,Did the listing actually say miniature?
3282,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?
3283,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time machine” and “need $800”."
3284,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,"It’s actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound."
3285,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.
3286,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,How are we going to get it upstairs?
3287,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator.
3288,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Yes but the elevator’s been broken for two years.
3289,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"I’ve been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that?"
3290,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,"Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When the Mars rover started pulling to the left I performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away."
3291,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,"No, that baby’s broken."
3292,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Come on, guys, push."
3293,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,If I push any harder I’m going to give birth to my colon.
3294,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"I can’t feel my fingers, hurry up."
3295,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"It’s the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics."
3296,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,Sheldon?
3297,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,Yeah.
3298,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"If my fingers ever work again, I’ve got a job for the middle one."
3299,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"Oh, hey guys."
3300,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Uh, hi Penny."
3301,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Take a break, guys!"
3302,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,What are you doing?
3303,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Oh, just, you know, moving… something upstairs."
3304,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,What is it?
3305,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"It’s… you know, time machine."
3306,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so…."
3307,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Uh, just give us a few minutes."
3308,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"I don’t have a few minutes, I’m running really late."
3309,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there’s a small gap, don’t look down if you’re subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell."
3310,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"You’re joking, right?"
3311,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo."
3312,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"Damn, okay, I’ll just take the roof."
3313,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it’s not… never mind."
3314,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"For what it’s worth, I thought it was humorous."
3315,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Let’s just do this. Guys, ready to push?"
3316,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up.
3317,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,I don’t know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.
3318,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned.
3319,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy."
3320,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,Talk about your chick magnets.
3321,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I’ve got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!"
3322,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I know we said we’d take turns, but I think you’d agree that practicality dictates it remain here."
3323,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,"You can’t just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, “you wanna come up and see my time machine, it’s at my friends house,” how lame is that?"
3324,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,He’s got a point.
3325,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Alright, I think we’re going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine."
3326,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Seconded.
3327,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,I was going to put down a towel.
3328,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.
3329,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,That sounds fair.
3330,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month?"
3331,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,Twice a month.
3332,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,Then no.
3333,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"Okay, every other month."
3334,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,No.
3335,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Sheldon, you can’t be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine."
3336,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10"
3337,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,"Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson."
3338,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Wait a minute, I’d want to see that too."
3339,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"So, when it’s your turn you can."
3340,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell’s lab is going to get very crowded, he’ll know something’s up."
3341,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"Also, since the time machine doesn’t move in space, you’ll end up in 1876 Pasadena."
3342,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,"And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, “hey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?”"
3343,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"Mrs Bell was deaf, she’s not even going to hear you knock."
3344,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device."
3345,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"Ooh, how far into the future?"
3346,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10"
3347,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,2328 by pre-federation reckoning.
3348,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10 , 2328. Here we go into the future."
3349,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,That was fun.
3350,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,My turn.
3351,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee."
3352,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Are you okay?
3353,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch."
3354,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,That doesn’t sound too bad.
3355,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son."
3356,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Sorry.
3357,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they’d given my shift away. Yeah, that’s right, I’ve lost an entire day’s pay thanks to this… this…"
3358,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,Time machine.
3359,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?"
3360,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"No! I don’t want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and… and now that… that…"
3361,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Again, time machine."
3362,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"Oh please, it’s not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades."
3363,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp.
3364,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Leonard, it’s two in the morning."
3365,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,So?
3366,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,So it’s my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?
3367,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.
3368,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"You can’t. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake."
3369,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?
3370,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious."
3371,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,What if I knocked you unconscious right now?
3372,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,It won’t change the past.
3373,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,But it would make the present so much nicer.
3374,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,Are you upset about something?
3375,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,What was your first clue?
3376,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability…"
3377,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Yes I’m upset.
3378,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,Oh! I don’t usually pick up on those things. Good for me.
3379,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Yeah, good for you."
3380,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what’s bothering you?"
3381,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,I don’t know. Maybe.
3382,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Wow, I’m on fire tonight."
3383,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Uh, here’s the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines."
3384,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.
3385,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Thanks for pointing it out.
3386,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother."
3387,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Those are movies.
3388,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,Well of course they’re movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That’s absurd.
3389,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Come on, guys, push."
3390,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,If I push any harder I’m going to give birth to my colon.
3391,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"Oh, hey guys."
3392,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Uh, hi Penny."
3393,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Take a break, guys!"
3394,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,What are you doing?
3395,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Oh, just, you know, moving a… time machine."
3396,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so…."
3397,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"But, what about your time machine."
3398,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"Oh, I’m scared."
3399,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Don’t worry baby, I’ve got you."
3400,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,It’s still my turn.
3401,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,What are you doing?
3402,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,I’m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.
3403,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen.
3404,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,It’s not about money.
3405,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,We brought food.
3406,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,"Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers."
3407,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?"
3408,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,Why?
3409,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Because I don’t want it any more.
3410,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,Why?
3411,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Just… personal reasons.
3412,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.
3413,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Look, do you want to buy me out or not?"
3414,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"I’ll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we’ll put it on my balcony."
3415,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,"Screw his balcony, I’ll give you a hundred and twenty and we’ll put it in my garage."
3416,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,I paid two hundred dollars for my share.
3417,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot."
3418,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"I’ll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is."
3419,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"Three hundred, and I’ll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects."
3420,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I’m getting rid of all of it."
3421,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,"You can’t do that, look what you’ve created here, it’s like nerdvana."
3422,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"More importantly, you’ve a Darth Vader voice changer?"
3423,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Not for long.
3424,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash."
3425,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,"Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection."
3426,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"Too bad, I called dibs."
3427,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,Well you can’t just call dibs.
3428,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia."
3429,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,Dibs doesn’t apply in a bidding war.
3430,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"It’s not a bidding war, I’m selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store."
3431,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?
3432,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,Will you forget dibs!
3433,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
3434,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"What’s the number, I’ll match it."
3435,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"I’ll match it, plus a thousand rupees."
3436,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,What’s the exchange rate.
3437,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,None of your business. Take it or leave it.
3438,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,"Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel."
3439,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me."
3440,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Who cares, as long as you pick me."
3441,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Raj,"Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let’s talk."
3442,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Sorry Raj, my mind is made up."
3443,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,No. I can’t let you do this.
3444,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Sheldon, get out of my way."
3445,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,None shall pass.
3446,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek"
3447,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,"Okay man, be cool, we’re all friends here."
3448,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,What the hell’s going on?
3449,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,You hypocrite!
3450,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,What?
3451,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Little Miss “grown ups don’t play with toys”. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty!"
3452,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset."
3453,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"No, I needed to hear it."
3454,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"No you didn’t. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are."
3455,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Howard,I guess that makes me large breasts.
3456,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Still, I think it’s time for me to get rid of this stuff and… you know… move on with my life."
3457,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,Really?
3458,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,Yeah.
3459,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don’t know, later…"
3460,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Good looking man coming up stairs,"Excuse me. Hey, Penny!"
3461,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,Hi Mike.
3462,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Mike,Are you ready to go.
3463,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"Yeah, I just have to change."
3464,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Mike,I’ll give you a hand.
3465,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Penny,"Oh, stop it! Bye guys."
3466,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,My turn on the time machine.
3467,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"Sheldon, are you okay?"
3468,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,We have to get rid of the time machine.
3469,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Leonard,"It is a little big for the living room, isn’t it?"
3470,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Yeah, that’s the problem, it’s too big."
3471,1,14,the nerdvana annhiliation,Sheldon,"Oh no, Morlocks? Eat him, eat him. Aaaaargh.  Leonard!!!!!!!!"
3472,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it."
3473,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,"Psh, what a bunch of crybabies. No guts, no glory man."
3474,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers."
3475,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,"We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here?"
3476,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"I don’t know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn’t have a bulletin board."
3477,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,What’s going on?
3478,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,Shhh! Hot girl in Sheldon’s office.
3479,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,Sheldon’s office? Is she lost?
3480,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,Don’t think so. I followed her here from the parking lot.
3481,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,Maybe she’s his lawyer.
3482,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,Well she’s free to examine my briefs.
3483,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,Howard…
3484,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"I know, I’m disgusting, I should be punished. By her, oh look, I did it again."
3485,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Girl,"Well, that should do it."
3486,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,Thank you for coming by.
3487,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,Hello.
3488,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Oh, hey buddy."
3489,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,Buddy.
3490,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"Sorry I’m late, I’m working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle."
3491,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"How can you be late, I wasn’t expecting you at all."
3492,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and… BAM!"
3493,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Sheldon, are you going to introduce us?"
3494,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you’ve already met Howard."
3495,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,It’s nice to meet you.
3496,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"You too, swell, also."
3497,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,Yeah.
3498,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"So, how do you two know each other."
3499,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,"Oh, he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head."
3500,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,Excuse me?
3501,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"She’s my twin sister, she thinks she’s funny but frankly I’ve never been able to see it."
3502,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,"It’s because you have no measurable sense of humour, Shelly."
3503,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,How exactly would one measure a sense of humour? A humourmometer?
3504,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"Well, I think you’re delightfully droll. Or as the French say, Tres Drole."
3505,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,Rajesh.
3506,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas?"
3507,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"Was it perhaps destiny, I think it was destiny."
3508,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,My friend’s getting married in Disneyland tomorrow night.
3509,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"Destiny, thy name is Anaheim."
3510,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,And I had to drop off some papers for Shelly to sign for my dad’s estate.
3511,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn’t she."
3512,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,I guess that’s why they call you a genius.
3513,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"They call me a genius because I’m a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds, and that I’m having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding, goodbye."
3514,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard and Howard together,"Woah, woah."
3515,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"If the wedding’s not until tomorrow, why don’t you stay with us tonight?"
3516,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,"Oh, I don’t think so. Shelly doesn’t like company. Even as a little boy he’d send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day."
3517,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues."
3518,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Look, you’re here, we have plenty of room."
3519,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,No we don’t.
3520,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"Come on, Shelly, she’s family."
3521,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,So what? I don’t issue invitations to your mother.
3522,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Well it would be nice not to have to drive out to Anaheim in rush hour.
3523,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,And don’t ever call me Shelly.
3524,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,So it’s settled. You’ll stay with us.
3525,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"I’ll walk you to your car. You’re in structure 3 level C, right?"
3526,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,What just happened?
3527,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,"So anyway, we’re eight years old, and Sheldon converts my easy-bake oven to some kind of high-powered furnace."
3528,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Hee-hee, just classic."
3529,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits.
3530,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,He was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room.
3531,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.
3532,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,"Anyway, I go to make those little corn muffins they give you, there’s a big flash, next thing you know my eyebrows are gone."
3533,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"Ha-ha, not your eyebrows?"
3534,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Yep. I had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my Mom drew on.
3535,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical.
3536,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,"Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs."
3537,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,Those are not mine.
3538,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,"Really, they have your little name label in them."
3539,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Yeah, no, I do, I use those… uh… just to polish up my… spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I’m not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon’s twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbour Penny."
3540,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Hi.
3541,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,"Wow, you don’t look that much alike."
3542,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,Can I get a hallelujah.
3543,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings."
3544,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,Hallelujah.
3545,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,"Hey, guess what. I’ve been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness."
3546,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,"Hey, good for you, Raj."
3547,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,"Yes, I’m very hopeful. Hello Missy."
3548,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,They mentioned there may be side effects.
3549,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,"So, Missy. Have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of India?"
3550,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,"Well, there’s Dr Patel at our church."
3551,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,"Ah yes, Dr Patel, good man."
3552,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"Do you like motorcycles, ‘cos I ride a hog."
3553,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,A hog? You have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front.
3554,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,You still have to wear a helmet.
3555,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?
3556,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,The sex book?
3557,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,"The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us."
3558,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,"Hey, Sheldon’s sister’s pretty cute, I w…."
3559,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,I wasn’t staring!
3560,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,"I didn’t say you were, I just said she was cute."
3561,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall… and perfect."
3562,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,"Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?"
3563,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,I’m not ignoring my sister. I’m ignoring all of you.
3564,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,I brought snacks.
3565,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Oh my! Gherkins and….
3566,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Onion dip, it’s onion dip."
3567,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Oh.
3568,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,We don’t entertain much.
3569,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,"Missy, do you enjoy pajamas?"
3570,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,I guess.
3571,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,We Indians invented them. You’re welcome.
3572,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. You’re welcome!"
3573,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,"Missy, I’m going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?"
3574,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,God yes. Thanks.
3575,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,You’re welcome.
3576,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Bye guys.
3577,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,Bye Missy.
3578,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Bye Missy, see you."
3579,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,Goodbye Leonard!
3580,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny."
3581,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"Okay, you two have to back off."
3582,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,"Why should I back off, you back off dude."
3583,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Excuse me, this is my apartment and she’s my roommate’s sister."
3584,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"So what, you’ve already got Penny."
3585,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?
3586,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,So I can have Penny?
3587,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Hell, no!"
3588,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Excuse me, can I interject something. I’m ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni?"
3589,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?"
3590,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"I guess. Don’t worry, I was going to order you cheeseless."
3591,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,Thank you.
3592,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,That’s okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.
3593,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"I’m a fancy Indian man, we invented pajamas!"
3594,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,"Hey, look at me, I don’t have a foreskin."
3595,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?"
3596,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It’s noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence."
3597,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"That’s fascinating, but I…"
3598,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"I didn’t say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy."
3599,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz… they’re hitting on your sister."
3600,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Oh. Okay. You know, I don’t want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we’d be a lot further along in this conversation if you’d begun with that thought."
3601,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"That’s great, but I…."
3602,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,What I’m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.
3603,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,Whatever. You have to do something about it.
3604,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,Why?
3605,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,Because she’s your sister.
3606,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"I don’t understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we’ve pretty much gone our own separate ways."
3607,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Okay, uh…. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate."
3608,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,I hadn’t considered that. We do share DNA.
3609,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,Uh-huh.
3610,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself."
3611,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister’s future offspring."
3612,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"You’re right. If someone wants to get at Missy’s fallopian tubes, they’ll have to go through me."
3613,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,"I am Shiva the destroyer, I will have the woman!"
3614,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"I’m warning you, I was judo champion at math camp."
3615,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Alright, that’s enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. I’m going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister."
3616,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,Who are you to decide that?
3617,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"He’s the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes."
3618,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"You’re out too, by the way."
3619,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,Say what?
3620,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"It’s nothing personal, I’d just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn’t become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie."
3621,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,What are you so happy about?
3622,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Now that Leonard’s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister."
3623,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that?
3624,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"We all make mistakes, let’s move on."
3625,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,"Excuse me, but I think you’re missing a big opportunity here."
3626,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,How so?
3627,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.
3628,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex."
3629,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"Is it ‘cause I’m Jewish, ‘cause I’d kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister."
3630,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you’re a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother."
3631,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable."
3632,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.
3633,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Oh really?
3634,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,Oops.
3635,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,"Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute? Alone?"
3636,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"We all make mistakes, let’s move on."
3637,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Okay. I’m not even going to ask why you’re pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?
3638,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Truthfully, I’ve never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential."
3639,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,What on earth are you talking about?
3640,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Let me explain. You see, I’m a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock."
3641,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,"And what do you mean, mediocre stock?"
3642,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will."
3643,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Sheldon 2.0?
3644,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you’re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced."
3645,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,You have got to be kidding me!
3646,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.
3647,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,"Okay Shelly, sit down. Now I’ve lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of God’s special little people."
3648,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that’s where the metaphor ended."
3649,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,I have an alternate proposal.
3650,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Go on.
3651,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins."
3652,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants.
3653,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"Look, we have to settle this."
3654,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,I agree. Sheldon’s sister is hiding at Penny’s because we’ve all been hitting on her at the same time.
3655,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,"She’s not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who’s apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair."
3656,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"Oh, you poor, deluded bastard."
3657,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,Don’t start with me dude.
3658,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,You want to go again? Let’s go.
3659,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,Sit down.
3660,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,Okay.
3661,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"If we’re going to fight over Missy, let’s do it the right way. The honourable way."
3662,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,And he’s down!
3663,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"Come on, come on, get up."
3664,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work."
3665,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,I weep for humanity.
3666,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,"Ah, hey Leonard."
3667,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Hi Penny, how’s it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?"
3668,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,"Uh, pretty much, why?"
3669,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please?"
3670,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,Of course.
3671,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,"Hi, Leonard, what’s up?"
3672,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Well, since you’re leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you’d like to go out to dinner with me?"
3673,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,That’s so sweet. But no thanks.
3674,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Oh. You have other plans, or…?"
3675,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,No.
3676,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,Oh. Alright uh… enjoy the rest of your evening.
3677,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Thanks. See you.
3678,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Leonard,"Um, here’s something we didn’t anticipate."
3679,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,"What do you want, Howard?"
3680,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,"I’m fine, thanks for asking. I’ve come to call on Missy."
3681,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,Missy?
3682,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Hi Howard.
3683,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Howard,The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?
3684,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Not really. No.
3685,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,No.
3686,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Penny,Missy?
3687,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,Thank you. I apprec….
3688,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Raj,apprec…. appreeee…. oh-oh.
3689,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,"Oh, hi, cutie pie. I was hoping you’d show up."
3690,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,We had a dog who made a noise like that. Had to put him down.
3691,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Any news you want me to pass along to Mom?
3692,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory."
3693,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,"Yeah, I’ll just tell her you said hey."
3694,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,"Come on, Shelly."
3695,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,I want you to know I’m very proud of you.
3696,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,Really?
3697,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,"Yup, I’m always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist."
3698,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,You tell people I’m a rocket scientist?
3699,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Well yeah.
3700,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,I’m a theoretical physicist.
3701,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,What’s the difference?
3702,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Sheldon,What’s the difference?
3703,1,15,the porkchop indeterminacy,Missy,Goodbye Shelly.
3704,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something."
3705,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Oh, it’s called trestling."
3706,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport.
3707,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Yeah, that’s terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out."
3708,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Right come on guys, come on."
3709,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you…"
3710,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"We might as well stop, it’s a stalemate. You’re beating me in tetris, but you’ve got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf."
3711,1,16,the peanut reaction,Raj,Keebler Elf? I’ve got your Keebler Elf right here.
3712,1,16,the peanut reaction,Raj,"Okay, it’s a stalemate."
3713,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?"
3714,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"He can’t eat cheesecake, he’s lactose intolerant."
3715,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Okay, he can have carrot cake."
3716,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,What about the cream cheese frosting.
3717,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,he can scrape it off.
3718,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday?"
3719,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybody’s until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants."
3720,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum."
3721,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Blah blah blah, a typical Taurus. So, seriously, are we going to see you Saturday?"
3722,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Oh, I don’t think so."
3723,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,Why not?
3724,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,I don’t celebrate my birthday.
3725,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Shuddup, yeah you do."
3726,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"No, it’s no big deal, it’s just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them."
3727,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Uh, that’s so silly."
3728,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"It’s actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it."
3729,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"What was it called, “I hate my son and that’s why he can’t have cake?”"
3730,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she’d also denied him Christmas he’d be a little better at it."
3731,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,Thank you.
3732,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Well I love birthdays, waking up to Mom’s special French Toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends."
3733,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Yeah, see, that’s what kids should have."
3734,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Actually that was last year.
3735,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,So you’ve really never had a birthday party?
3736,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was little I’d think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favourite."
3737,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,And?
3738,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Oh my God, that’s terrible."
3739,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so…7"
3740,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever heard.
3741,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"You think? Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom."
3742,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Make sure they remember no peanuts.
3743,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can’t eat peanuts. They see me coming they go “ah, no peanut boy!”"
3744,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,Hello Penny. Leonard just left.
3745,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,I know. I want to talk to you.
3746,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"What would we talk about? We’ve no overlapping areas of interest I’m aware of, and you know I don’t care for chit-chat."
3747,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Okay, can you just let me in."
3748,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Well alright, but I don’t see this as a promising endeavour."
3749,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Okay, here’s the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday."
3750,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn’t want a party."
3751,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Did someone say party?
3752,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,He just doesn’t know he wants one because he’s never had one.
3753,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"I suppose that’s possible, but for the record, I’ve never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one."
3754,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Howard, here’s the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over."
3755,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Fine. If I do have a threesome, you can’t be part of it. I’m just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend?"
3756,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish.
3757,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,Anguish?
3758,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation."
3759,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party."
3760,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity."
3761,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,Nevertheless we are….
3762,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,In addition I really don’t think that Leonard wants a…
3763,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Okay, here’s the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won’t know which, I’ll draw a tiny happy face in ink."
3764,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"You can’t do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it’s no longer mint."
3765,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?"
3766,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Well of course I… oh! Yeah, I have an idea, let’s throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party."
3767,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,What difference does it make?
3768,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one’s co-conspirators.
3769,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,Is that Raj and Howard?
3770,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Can you just let us in.
3771,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor.
3772,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"So, what did you get the birthday boy?"
3773,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Well, Raj got him an awesome limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross’s definitive Batman, and I got him this amazing autographed copy of the Feynman lectures on physics."
3774,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,Nice. I got him a sweater.
3775,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Okay, well, he might like that, I’ve seen him… chilly."
3776,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Uh, Sheldon, I didn’t see your present."
3777,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,That’s because I didn’t bring one.
3778,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,Well why not?
3779,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Don’t ask.
3780,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.
3781,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Too late.
3782,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Let’s say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, it’s a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it?"
3783,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Told you not to ask.
3784,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Well, Sheldon, you’re his friend. Friends give each other presents."
3785,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion."
3786,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Try telling him it’s a non-optional social convention.
3787,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,What?
3788,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Just do it.
3789,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,It’s a non-optional social convention.
3790,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,Oh. Fair enough.
3791,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,He came with a manual.
3792,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don’t drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers."
3793,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Okay, let’s do this, um, I will drive Sheldon to get a present, and Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard for about two hours."
3794,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,No problem.
3795,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"And then Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up."
3796,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,What if guests show up?
3797,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,Entertain them.
3798,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,What if they’re women?
3799,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable.
3800,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Hey!
3801,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,Hey.
3802,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,How’s it going?
3803,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,Fine.
3804,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"So, listen, the New Art is showing the revised definitive cut of Blade Runner."
3805,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,Seen it.
3806,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"No, you’ve seen the 25  anniversary final cut. This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage. They say it completely changes the tone of the film."
3807,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,Oh. Pass.
3808,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Come on, afterwards there’s a Q & A with Harrison Ford’s body double."
3809,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here, there’s this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7."
3810,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Can’t you play him some other time?
3811,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,Not if you believe his doctors.
3812,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Oh my God, do you smell gas."
3813,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,No.
3814,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Yeah, no."
3815,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Alright, you know they have DVDs over there."
3816,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner."
3817,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Sheldon, a gift shouldn’t be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn’t buy for themselves."
3818,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"You mean, like a sweater?"
3819,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Well, it’s a fun sweater, it’s got a bold geometric print."
3820,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,Is it the geometry that makes it fun.
3821,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them."
3822,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner."
3823,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,Exactly.
3824,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Something he wouldn’t buy for himself. Something fun. Something like… oh, an 802.11n wireless router."
3825,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade."
3826,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Come on, come on, oh you clever little…. Come on, come on, take that!"
3827,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Oh-oh.
3828,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,What’s the matter?
3829,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"This granola bar, there’s peanuts in it."
3830,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Oh my God, why did you eat it?"
3831,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"I don’t know, it was just there."
3832,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Well if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself?"
3833,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Don’t yell at me, I’ve got to go to the emergency room."
3834,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,Now?
3835,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket."
3836,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys."
3837,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh…."
3838,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,The laundry is out of the hamper.
3839,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Okay Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine, it’s out of the washer. I’ll call you when it’s in the dryer."
3840,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,What do you think.
3841,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Um, that one."
3842,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.
3843,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,Sure.
3844,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"He doesn’t need them, he’s already got a 640 connect switch"
3845,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Oh, okay then this one."
3846,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,Why?
3847,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"I don’t know, the man on the box looks so happy."
3848,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Penny! If I’m going to buy Leonard a gift, I’m going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did."
3849,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Oh, I know I’m going to regret this but, what trauma?"
3850,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes."
3851,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,Of course.
3852,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me… wow, this is hard. They got me… a motorised dirt bike."
3853,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,No?
3854,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike?
3855,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,All of them.
3856,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,Really?
3857,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,Yeah.
3858,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,Huh?
3859,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Okay, so we’re getting this one?"
3860,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Yeah, I suppose."
3861,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Okay, let’s go."
3862,1,16,the peanut reaction,Random woman,"Excuse me, do you know anything about this stuff?"
3863,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,I know everything about this stuff.
3864,1,16,the peanut reaction,Woman,"Okay, I have my own wholesale flower business, and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance with the one in my refrigerated warehouse."
3865,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Here, buy this one. Look, it’s the one we’re getting, see, happy guy available."
3866,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, she doesn’t want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender."
3867,1,16,the peanut reaction,Woman,Thank you.
3868,1,16,the peanut reaction,Random guy,"Which hard drive do I want, firewire or USB?"
3869,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,It depends on what Bus you have.
3870,1,16,the peanut reaction,Guy,I drive a Chevy Cavalier.
3871,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, dear lord."
3872,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Sheldon, we have to go."
3873,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Not now, Penny, this poor man needs me."
3874,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"You hold on, I’ll be right with you. What computer do you have, and please don’t say a white one?"
3875,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Excuse me.
3876,1,16,the peanut reaction,Nurse,"Fill this out, have a seat."
3877,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"No, listen, see we’re throwing my friend a surprise party and I’m supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours."
3878,1,16,the peanut reaction,Nurse,"Uh-huh, fill this out and have a seat."
3879,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut. Because I’m allergic to peanuts."
3880,1,16,the peanut reaction,Nurse,"Oh, well in that case fill this out and have a seat."
3881,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half."
3882,1,16,the peanut reaction,Nurse,Is that all you need?
3883,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Yes.
3884,1,16,the peanut reaction,Nurse,Get out of my ER.
3885,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"No, you don’t understand."
3886,1,16,the peanut reaction,Nurse,"Oh, I understand, but unfortunately this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid."
3887,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Okay, I get it, I know how the world works, how about if I were to introduce you"
3888,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,to the man who freed your people.
3889,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Nurse, unless my people were freed by Benjamin Franklin and his five twin brothers you are wasting your time."
3890,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Hey, sorry I couldn’t find a parking spot, how are you doing."
3891,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Bad, very bad."
3892,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Really, ‘cos you don’t look like you’re swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home."
3893,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,We can’t go home.
3894,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,Why not?
3895,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Becauth-th-th. Brissket, Brissket! Water, need water."
3896,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Alright, I’ll be right back."
3897,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Penny, look, I’ve got a problem."
3898,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Yeah, well so do I, look you’ve got to stall Leonard a little longer."
3899,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,I don’t think I can.
3900,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"You have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell “surprise!”"
3901,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Okay, you have to understand something, we’re in a hospital right now."
3902,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Why, is Leonard okay."
3903,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Leonard’s fine. I’m fine, thanks for asking, by the way."
3904,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Okay, I don’t need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer."
3905,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Look, I’ve done my best but he wants to go home and I don’t know how to stop him."
3906,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Okay, how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party I’ll point out which of my friends are easy."
3907,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Don’t toy with me, woman."
3908,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"I’ve got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, I’ve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who’s two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat."
3909,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Okay, we don’t have that in stock, but I can special order it for you."
3910,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,Him.
3911,1,16,the peanut reaction,Assistant,"Excuse me, sir, you don’t work here."
3912,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else."
3913,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Sheldon, we have to go."
3914,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,Why?
3915,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"Well, for one thing, we’re late for Leonard’s birthday party. And for another, I told him to call security."
3916,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,Good luck.
3917,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"By the way, a six year-old could hack your computer system."
3918,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,Keep walking.
3919,1,16,the peanut reaction,Sheldon,"Yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password."
3920,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts."
3921,1,16,the peanut reaction,Nurse,No he’s not.
3922,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,Yes he is.
3923,1,16,the peanut reaction,Nurse,"Look, sir we are very busy here and I just don’t…"
3924,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Pees hep me!
3925,1,16,the peanut reaction,Nurse,"Code 4, I need a gurney, right away, right away."
3926,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Fank-u.
3927,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they’re afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything."
3928,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,I really don’t think the colonoscopy was necessary.
3929,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"You know, before you got all swollen up, I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party."
3930,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Oh, right, it’s your birthday, I had no idea it was your birthday, I completely forgot, wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday, well it’s all over now."
3931,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"There is a party, isn’t there."
3932,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Maybe.
3933,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,Howard.
3934,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,Are you mad?
3935,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,how could I be mad? You actually risked your life because you cared about me.
3936,1,16,the peanut reaction,Howard,"Yeah, that’s why I did it."
3937,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,Alright. Here we go. My first birthday party.
3938,1,16,the peanut reaction,Raj,Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise!
3939,1,16,the peanut reaction,Raj,"Okay Leonard, here I am at your birthday party, I don’t know where you are dude, but it’s really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk, and uh…"
3940,1,16,the peanut reaction,Raj,"Oh look, there’s a girl taking her shirt off."
3941,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,"That’s my friend Carol. Remind me, I’ve got to introduce her to Howard."
3942,1,16,the peanut reaction,Raj,"Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker."
3943,1,16,the peanut reaction,Penny,I’m so sorry you didn’t get your party.
3944,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Oh, it’s okay."
3945,1,16,the peanut reaction,Leonard,"Hey Penny, when, uh, when’s your birthday?"
3946,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,Wo de zhing shi Sheldon.
3947,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,That’s what you did. I assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.
3948,1,17,the tangerine factor,Howard,Well it’s not.
3949,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher it’s your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter.
3950,1,17,the tangerine factor,Howard,"You know, I’m really glad you decided to learn Mandarin."
3951,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,Why?
3952,1,17,the tangerine factor,Howard,Once you’re fluent you’ll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me.
3953,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Hey!
3954,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,Mai du lui tsa.
3955,1,17,the tangerine factor,Howard,You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey.
3956,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"My apologies Leonard, I’m only as good as my teacher."
3957,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Why are you learning Chinese?
3958,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them.
3959,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"If I were you, I’d be more concerned by what they’re passing off as chicken."
3960,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,I need to use your window.
3961,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Oh, yeah, no, sure, go ahead."
3962,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,What’s going on?
3963,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Okay, where were we?"
3964,1,17,the tangerine factor,Howard,"Not now, I have a blog to find."
3965,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Penny, are you okay?"
3966,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"I’m fine, Leonard, just go away."
3967,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Look, I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful…."
3968,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,GO AWAY!
3969,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Okay, feel better, bye."
3970,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,She doesn’t want to talk.
3971,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Not surprising. Penny’s emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala, while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless."
3972,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,Or maybe she just doesn’t want to talk.
3973,1,17,the tangerine factor,Raj,"Hey, look, I found an iPod."
3974,1,17,the tangerine factor,Howard,"It’s smashed beyond repair, what are you going to do with it?"
3975,1,17,the tangerine factor,Raj,What else? Sell it on ebay as slightly used.
3976,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"It was Penny’s boyfriend’s, they broke up."
3977,1,17,the tangerine factor,Howard,"Apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog, which I cannot find anywhere."
3978,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"You know what, I’m going to go back and try talking to her again."
3979,1,17,the tangerine factor,Howard,"Good idea. Sit with her, hold her, comfort her, and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel."
3980,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"I’m not going to do that, Howard."
3981,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,I’m not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.
3982,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,What about “damsel in distress?”
3983,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Twelfth century code of chivalry, not exactly current. You’d also have to be knighted for that to apply."
3984,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"I don’t care. She’s upset, I’m going over there."
3985,1,17,the tangerine factor,Howard,Remember to sit on your hands a bit so they’re warm.
3986,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"I’m her friend, I’m not going to take advantage of her vulnerability."
3987,1,17,the tangerine factor,Howard,"What, so you’re saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her, right there, right now, you’ll just walk away?"
3988,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,I said I’m her friend. Not her gay friend.
3989,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Hey, listen, I know you said that you didn’t want to talk…"
3990,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,I don’t.
3991,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Sorry.
3992,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,Wait.
3993,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Wait, did you say wait?"
3994,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,Tell me the truth. Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?
3995,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,No. No.
3996,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Okay, so I pick good guys, but turn them into losers."
3997,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Of course not.
3998,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Well, it’s got to be one or the other, which is it?"
3999,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"I’m sorry, what were the choices again?"
4000,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"I really thought Mike was different, I thought he was sensitive and smart. I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart."
4001,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Yeah, no, sure."
4002,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"You know, and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it."
4003,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Actually it’s not all that easy to find.
4004,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Yeah, really, well my friends at work found it, my sister found it, judging by my email a number of prisoners at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it."
4005,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that I need to know the details of your sex life, I just thought…. never mind."
4006,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Nope, you know what, you might as well read it, everybody else has, go ahead. Oh God, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed. I just want to crawl into a hole and die."
4007,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Okay, well, you know, this isn’t that bad. It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who’s open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales."
4008,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,Oh God!
4009,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Elevators, parks, movie theatres, out of curiosity, is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop?"
4010,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,Sandwich shop.
4011,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Doesn’t that violate the health code?
4012,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"No, at the sub shop we were only making out."
4013,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Huh. Okay. But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed.
4014,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Really, do you think I overreacted?"
4015,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Maybe a little.
4016,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"‘Cause I do that, I do overreact. Maybe I should call Mike and apologise."
4017,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"No. No, no, that, that would be underreacting. He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise."
4018,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,Yes. You’re right. I should just say I’m done with him.
4019,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Yes, you should, go ahead, say it."
4020,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,But I never gave the man a chance to explain.
4021,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"What is there to explain, it’s all right here, it’s a betrayal."
4022,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"No, you were right the first time, this is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels."
4023,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,I’m pretty sure I never said that.
4024,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"No, you did better than that, you helped me see it on my own."
4025,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Aw, good for me. Where are you going?"
4026,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"I’m going over to Mike’s. Leonard, thank you so much."
4027,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Oh, sure. Huh, maybe I am her gay friend."
4028,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Howard, I’m going to need another Mandarin lesson. I obviously didn’t make my point with those people."
4029,1,17,the tangerine factor,Howard,"For God’s sake, Sheldon, if you don’t like the tangerine chicken, don’t order the tangerine chicken."
4030,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"I like tangerine chicken, I’m not getting tangerine chicken."
4031,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Can we please change the subject.
4032,1,17,the tangerine factor,Raj,Sure. Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend.
4033,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Just roll the dice.
4034,1,17,the tangerine factor,Raj,"Enslaved by warlocks, stay here till you roll 2, 4 or 6…7"
4035,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"She was mad at him. She was done with him, the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it!"
4036,1,17,the tangerine factor,Howard,"Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it."
4037,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Actually, I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character, now I just find him to be whiny and annoying."
4038,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Just eat your tangerine chicken.
4039,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"I’d love to, but I don’t have tangerine chicken."
4040,1,17,the tangerine factor,Raj,Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw-up.
4041,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,I’m back.
4042,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,I’m sorry I yelled at you. It’s not your fault.
4043,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,What happened?
4044,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Well, I went over to Mike’s to make up with him."
4045,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Yeah, I know, I know that part."
4046,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,But he had already moved on.
4047,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Already, that was quick."
4048,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,That’s what I said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck.
4049,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Oh, Penny, I am so sorry."
4050,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,How could he do that.
4051,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig iPod… yeah, no, how could he do that."
4052,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"I swear to God, I am done with guys like that. You know, macho, with the perfect body and the hair, and the money."
4053,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Yeah, that must get old quick."
4054,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"You know, just once, I would like to go out with someone who is nice, and honest, and who actually cares about me."
4055,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,What about me?
4056,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,What about you what?
4057,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,What about if you went out with me?
4058,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,Are you asking me out?
4059,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Um… yes… I am… asking you out.
4060,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,Wow.
4061,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,I was just going off your comment about the nice guy…
4062,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"No, I know, I got that. Yeah, totally."
4063,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"…thing and honest but, it’s no big deal…"
4064,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,Yes.
4065,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Yes what?
4066,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Yes, I will go out with you."
4067,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Really?
4068,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Yeah. Why not, I mean, what do I have to lose?"
4069,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Yeah. That’s the spirit.
4070,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your…"
4071,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,Sheldon.
4072,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,Aieee ya! Xia si wo le.
4073,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"I’m sorry. Look, do you have a second."
4074,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,A second what? Pair of underwear?
4075,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,I was just wondering if I could talk to you? It’s about Leonard.
4076,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?
4077,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Well, Raj can’t talk to me unless he’s drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting."
4078,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Yes, I suppose he is."
4079,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"All I’m saying is, you know Leonard the best."
4080,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment."
4081,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,We’re not done?
4082,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,No.
4083,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Ach, why not? We’re already through the looking glass anyway."
4084,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Okay, so, here’s the thing. I guess you’re aware that Leonard asked me out."
4085,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Well, he didn’t actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia."
4086,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Oh, that’s nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just… want to sit down?"
4087,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I don’t spend much time here and so I’ve never really chosen a place to sit."
4088,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Well, choose."
4089,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"There are a number of options and, I’m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice."
4090,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Alright, why don’t you just pick one at random, and then if you don’t like it you can sit somewhere else next time."
4091,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"No, no, that’s crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out."
4092,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Okay. Um, here’s the thing. So, I’ve known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me…"
4093,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy."
4094,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Alright, yeah, I don’t really know who they are…"
4095,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon…
4096,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Yeah, I don’t care, I don’t care. The point is Leonard isn’t the kind of guy I usually go out with."
4097,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,Leonard isn’t the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees?
4098,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"No. What I’m saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well."
4099,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare!"
4100,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"But on the other hand, if things don’t go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend. I mean, I guess he’s not looking for a fling, he’s the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I don’t know, like you would say light years."
4101,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time."
4102,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,Thank you for the clarification.
4103,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that’s a unit of work, not of weight."
4104,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Right, thanks."
4105,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,It’s a common mistake.
4106,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,Not the first one I’ve made today.
4107,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,Okay. I think this will be my seat.
4108,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I’m talking about."
4109,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Well, let’s see. We might consider Schrodinger’s Cat."
4110,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?
4111,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"No. That’s Mrs Grossinger. And she doesn’t have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip…"
4112,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,Sheldon!
4113,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead."
4114,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"I’m sorry, I don’t get the point."
4115,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Well of course you don’t get it, I haven’t made it yet. You’d have to be psychic to get it, and there’s no such thing as psychic."
4116,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Sheldon, what’s the point?"
4117,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Just like Schrodinger’s Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you’ll find out which it is."
4118,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Okay, so you’re saying I should go out with Leonard."
4119,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me start again. In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger…"
4120,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Two seats right there.
4121,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Sheldon, I think I’ve made a mistake."
4122,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"I can see that. Unless you’re planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy."
4123,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"No, it’s about Penny."
4124,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"A mistake involving Penny? Okay, you’ll have to narrow it down."
4125,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,I don’t think I can go out with her tonight.
4126,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,Then don’t.
4127,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Other people would say “why not?”
4128,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,Other people might be interested.
4129,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,I’m going to talk anyway.
4130,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,I assumed you would.
4131,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Now that I’m actually about to go out with Penny, I’m not excited, I’m nauseous."
4132,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion."
4133,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Right.
4134,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on."
4135,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny, what happens if I blow it."
4136,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind."
4137,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,You’re not helping.
4138,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?"
4139,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.
4140,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,Schrodinger’s Cat.
4141,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Wow, that’s brilliant."
4142,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,Hi.
4143,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Hi.
4144,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,come on in.
4145,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,Thank you. You look very nice.
4146,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,Thank you. So do you.
4147,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,I made an eight o’clock reservation.
4148,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first."
4149,1,17,the tangerine factor,Leonard,"Oh. Okay. But before you say anything, have you ever heard of Schrodinger’s Cat?"
4150,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Actually, I’ve heard far too much about Schrodinger’s Cat."
4151,1,17,the tangerine factor,Penny,"Alright, the cat’s alive, let’s go to dinner."
4152,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,Show me your mucus! Your mucus!
4153,1,17,the tangerine factor,Owner,Blow your own nose and go away.
4154,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,This is not a tangerine bicycle.
4155,1,17,the tangerine factor,Owner,Crazy man. Call the police.
4156,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,No. Don’t call the library. Show me your mucus.
4157,1,17,the tangerine factor,Sheldon,"Oxen are in my bed! Many, many oxen! Oy Vey!"
4158,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"So you see, what you’re eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn’t have enough live acidophilus cultures. It’s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness."
4159,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Oh, that’s very interesting."
4160,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,It’s also not pink and has no berries.
4161,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Yeah, but it doesn’t really answer my question."
4162,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,What was your question again?
4163,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,Do you want some.
4164,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Oh, right, no, I’m lactose intolerant."
4165,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,Right.
4166,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"So, gas."
4167,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,Got it.
4168,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,What are you doing?
4169,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,There was a draft.
4170,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,I didn’t feel a draft.
4171,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,Why don’t we just go into your….
4172,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little."
4173,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"No, no, I didn’t mean to go into your apartment to… go fast."
4174,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"No, I know, I… I know what you meant, it’s just… it’s only our first date."
4175,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don’t we just figure out where we’re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R."
4176,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,Or we could just wing it.
4177,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,That might work too.
4178,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,Goodnight Leonard.
4179,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,He’s coming. Screen saver.
4180,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,"Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?"
4181,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?"
4182,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing."
4183,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,"You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box."
4184,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"What are you talking about, the date went fine."
4185,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,"Dude, she said she wants to slow things down."
4186,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It’s like saying “I’m really enjoying this meal, I’m going to slow down and savour it.”"
4187,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,"No, it’s like “this fish tastes bad, so I’m going to slow down and spit it out.”"
4188,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,You being the fish.
4189,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,I’m not the fish.
4190,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,"Oh really, did you make a second date."
4191,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Well, we sort of decided to wing it."
4192,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Oh, even I know that’s lame."
4193,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Okay, alright, let’s assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong."
4194,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,I didn’t say anything like that.
4195,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,"Good, ‘cos they don’t work."
4196,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,"They also don’t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that’s my home run swing."
4197,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Look, everything went fine. I didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me."
4198,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,"Let’s go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest."
4199,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,"Nice close up, by the way."
4200,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans."
4201,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,That’s not a bad sign.
4202,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement."
4203,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,"And the worst sign of all is, you’re here and not there."
4204,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"I’m not there because I’m taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera."
4205,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.
4206,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,Give him time.
4207,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,Hi.
4208,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I’d avoid using that for your delicates."
4209,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,Thanks.
4210,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Oh, good Lord. Why don’t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?"
4211,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Sheldon, may I ask you a question?"
4212,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"I would prefer that you not, but I won’t go so far as to forbid it."
4213,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Alright, I heard yes, so… okay, here’s my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl."
4214,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Well I assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.
4215,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn’t a braniac?"
4216,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature."
4217,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,How is that not a braniac?
4218,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature."
4219,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he’ll eventually get bored with me."
4220,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,That depends.
4221,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,On what?
4222,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?
4223,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,No.
4224,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Do you speak Klingon?
4225,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,No.
4226,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Do you know any card tricks?
4227,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college."
4228,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Why would you lie about that?
4229,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn’t want him to think I was some stupid loser."
4230,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?
4231,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates."
4232,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Yeah, but you were neither."
4233,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this."
4234,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,You’re asking me to keep a secret?
4235,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,Yeah.
4236,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Well I’m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis."
4237,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,What?
4238,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility."
4239,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"It’s a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself."
4240,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment."
4241,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Physiologically impossible.
4242,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Oh Sheldon, please, look, I’m asking you as a friend."
4243,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,So you’re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?
4244,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Well, yeah."
4245,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends?"
4246,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"I.e, I couldn’t become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman."
4247,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,You could be Batman?
4248,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Sure.
4249,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,I’m Batman. See.
4250,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,Hi guys.
4251,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,Hey.
4252,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Hi Penny.
4253,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Hey, Penny, if you’re not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie."
4254,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday."
4255,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,What about Saturday?
4256,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"You know, I’m not sure, the manager hasn’t posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know."
4257,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,Great. So you just let me know when you know. So…
4258,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?"
4259,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,What does that mean?
4260,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.
4261,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,No I didn’t.
4262,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir."
4263,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,What’s going on with you?
4264,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,What’s wrong with your face?
4265,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"There’s no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard."
4266,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,What?
4267,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,Good day?
4268,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that’s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day…"
4269,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,You must release me from my oath.
4270,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Sheldon, I’m working."
4271,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Why don’t you take a minute to decide
4272,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,I can’t keep your secret Penny. I’m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.
4273,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?"
4274,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"I’m constitutionally incapable. That’s why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me."
4275,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?"
4276,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.
4277,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you’re just going to have to figure out a way to do it."
4278,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m moving out."
4279,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"What do you mean, you’re moving out? Why?"
4280,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,There doesn’t have to be a reason.
4281,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Yeah, there kind of does."
4282,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen’s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it’s ultimately circular, i.e., I’m moving out because I’m moving out."
4283,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,I’m still confused.
4284,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Leonard, I don’t see how I could have made it any simpler."
4285,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,"Hey, qu’est q’wass up?"
4286,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.
4287,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,And some of those skinless chicks were hot.
4288,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to pack."
4289,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,That’s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.
4290,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"It’s not you, Howard, he says he’s moving out."
4291,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?
4292,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,No.
4293,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,Did you take a band aid off in front of him?
4294,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,No.
4295,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,"Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door?"
4296,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,"Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often?"
4297,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,No.
4298,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,Did you make fun of trains?
4299,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"I didn’t do anything, he’s just gone insane."
4300,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,"Well, we all knew this day was coming."
4301,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,That was fast.
4302,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,It’s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor.
4303,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,Where are you gonna live?
4304,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends.
4305,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,"Well you can’t stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment."
4306,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Excuse me, but isn’t hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?"
4307,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,I hate trains.
4308,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Don’t be ridiculous, you love trains."
4309,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,This could work.
4310,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,This is a very old building.
4311,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.
4312,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Uh-oh.
4313,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,What?
4314,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Don’t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?
4315,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,Not until now.
4316,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"I can’t believe I didn’t bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn’t pack it."
4317,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,"Well, if you’re not comfortable staying here, Sheldon…"
4318,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"I’m kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo."
4319,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,Terrific.
4320,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?
4321,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,"Yes, isn’t she an amazing actress."
4322,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Actually, I’d say she’s a poor man’s Madhuri Dixit."
4323,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Raj,How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.
4324,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you. Obviously you’re not that familiar with Indian cinema."
4325,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,Who is it?
4326,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,Shouldn’t you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?
4327,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,I’ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever.
4328,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,Maybe you’d be happier on a park bench?
4329,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,I don’t see any way to get a park bench in here.
4330,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,Do you want to switch?
4331,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"No, that’s fine. I’m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle."
4332,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,"Get out of bed, we’re switching."
4333,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Now, only if you want to."
4334,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,Just get in the bed!
4335,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard’s mother,What’s going on? Are you boys roughhousing?
4336,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,We’re just talking ma.
4337,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard’s mother,"If you don’t settle down right now, I’m not going to let you have any more sleepovers."
4338,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,"For God’s sake, ma, I’m 27 years old. It’s not even a school night!"
4339,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,Comfy now?
4340,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Meh. That poster of Halle Berry’s a little unnerving.
4341,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,So don’t look at it.
4342,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,She’s like my fourth favourite catwoman.
4343,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,No kidding?
4344,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her."
4345,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,What about Lee Meriwether?
4346,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether."
4347,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,Well I’m glad that’s settled.
4348,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There’s Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether…"
4349,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,"Please, I’m begging you, go to sleep."
4350,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"I’m trying, I’m counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though."
4351,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,Oh for God’s sake.
4352,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"But she’s not my favourite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel…."
4353,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,What’s with him?
4354,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Howard,"Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn’t get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom’s valium in it. But he still wouldn’t shut up, so, tag, you’re it."
4355,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,I’m ba-ack!
4356,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,I still don’t know why you left.
4357,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,I can’t tell you.
4358,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,Why not.
4359,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,I promised Penny.
4360,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,You promised Penny what?
4361,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,That I wouldn’t tell you the secret. Shhhhh!
4362,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,What secret. Tell me the secret.
4363,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can’t tell Dad."
4364,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Not that secret, the other secret."
4365,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,I’m Batman. Shhhhh!
4366,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret."
4367,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"Okay, I’ll tell you, but you can’t tell Leonard."
4368,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,I promise.
4369,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she’s not smart enough for Leonard.
4370,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,So it’s nothing I did? It’s her problem?
4371,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,I drank milk that tasted funny.
4372,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Penny thinks I’m too smart for her, that’s ridiculous."
4373,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Sheldon,"I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don’t worry, that’s not a secret. Everybody knows."
4374,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,Hi.
4375,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Yeah, hi, listen, I know what’s been bothering you about us, and I have the answer."
4376,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,What are you talking about.
4377,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"First I want to say that it’s not Sheldon’s fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn’t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave."
4378,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,He told you?
4379,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,Pasadena city college?
4380,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here’s playing hacky sack, and this girl’s going to be a paralegal."
4381,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can’t date a girl without a fancy college degree."
4382,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Well, it’s really not that fancy, it’s just a city college."
4383,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?"
4384,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,That doesn’t matter to me at all.
4385,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Penny,"So, it’s fine with you if I’m not smart."
4386,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,Absolutely.
4387,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,"Okay, this time I know where I went wrong."
4388,2,1,the bad fish paradigm,Leonard,Oh bite me!
4389,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Worst Renaissance Fair ever.
4390,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Please let it go, Sheldon."
4391,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine."
4392,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,You’re nitpicking.
4393,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Oh-ho! Really? Well here’s another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.
4394,2,2,the codpiece topology,Howard,Renaissance fairs aren’t about historical accuracy. They’re about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko’s and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.
4395,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said “huzzah!”
4396,2,2,the codpiece topology,Howard,"I don’t care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation."
4397,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,Hi guys. Looks like you’ve been to the Renaissance fair. I’m hoping.
4398,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.
4399,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric."
4400,2,2,the codpiece topology,Howard,Hello.
4401,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Hi.
4402,2,2,the codpiece topology,Eric,Hey.
4403,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"So, yeah, good to see you."
4404,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Yeah, yeah, it’s good to see you too. We should really go."
4405,2,2,the codpiece topology,Eric,Yeah.
4406,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,Bye guys.
4407,2,2,the codpiece topology,Eric,Like your hat.
4408,2,2,the codpiece topology,Howard,"Thanks, my mom made it. Penny with a new guy, tres awkward."
4409,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"It wasn’t awkward. It wasn’t fun. Besides, what’s the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we’re both moving on."
4410,2,2,the codpiece topology,Raj,"By moving on, do you mean, she’s going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?"
4411,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you can’t just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it."
4412,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear."
4413,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,You’re wearing modern underwear?
4414,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?"
4415,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.
4416,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,You went out and bought linen?
4417,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Don’t be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases."
4418,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Borrowed?
4419,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"You know what, I’m happy that Penny’s moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself."
4420,2,2,the codpiece topology,Howard,Are you saying that you’ve been holding back?
4421,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Of course. Out of respect.
4422,2,2,the codpiece topology,Howard,"So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny?"
4423,2,2,the codpiece topology,Raj,Who were you respecting then?
4424,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"What? I’ve dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle."
4425,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two."
4426,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?"
4427,2,2,the codpiece topology,Raj,Doesn’t count.
4428,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Why not?
4429,2,2,the codpiece topology,Raj,"What happens in costume at Comic-con, stays at Comic-con."
4430,2,2,the codpiece topology,Howard,You’re only saying that because of what happened to you.
4431,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,What happened to you?
4432,2,2,the codpiece topology,Raj,N-n-n-nothing happened to me.
4433,2,2,the codpiece topology,Howard,"It wasn’t your fault, Raj, he was dressed as a green Orion slave girl."
4434,2,2,the codpiece topology,Raj,"H-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude, you have totally not moved on."
4435,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Yes I have, it’s just a matter of actually making a date with someone."
4436,2,2,the codpiece topology,Howard,Like who?
4437,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Well, there’s Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it’s a little geographically undesireable."
4438,2,2,the codpiece topology,Raj,What about Leslie Winkle.
4439,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Oh no.
4440,2,2,the codpiece topology,Raj,Why?
4441,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Her research methodology is sloppy, she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me."
4442,2,2,the codpiece topology,Raj,I think she’s smoking hot.
4443,2,2,the codpiece topology,Howard,I’d hit that.
4444,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,You’d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.
4445,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Look, I like Leslie, but she’s not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release."
4446,2,2,the codpiece topology,Howard,"Yeah, so, be a tool. Go get yourself a little rebound stress release."
4447,2,2,the codpiece topology,Raj,Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.
4448,2,2,the codpiece topology,Howard,You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?
4449,2,2,the codpiece topology,Raj,"I bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it."
4450,2,2,the codpiece topology,Raj,And he told me his name was Kimberley!
4451,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,You know how I know we’re not in The Matrix?
4452,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,How?
4453,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"If we were, the food would be better."
4454,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"Hey, Leonard."
4455,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Hey, Leslie."
4456,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"Hey, dummy."
4457,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person."
4458,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"Ooh, rush me to the burn unit. Hey, Leonard, do you have a second, I need to ask you something."
4459,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Uh, sure."
4460,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Well, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me."
4461,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"Wow. So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory."
4462,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Where did you hear that?
4463,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,Actually I read it. Wolowitz texted me.
4464,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.
4465,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"I thought it was a pretty good one, I gave him an L-O-L. Anyway, it got me thinking, now that you’re unattached maybe we can revisit our previous attachment."
4466,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.
4467,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"No, I’m all done with casual sex. From now on I’m fully committed to the traditional relationship paradigm."
4468,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Really, what changed?"
4469,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"It’s hard to say, I guess there’s just a time in every woman’s life when she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon with a bunch of people she doesn’t know."
4470,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Yeah, I can see how that would… a bunch of people?"
4471,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"Anyway, I just figure it’s time to slow things down and who better to slow things down with than you?"
4472,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Oh, I’m flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?"
4473,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"Your place, we’ll order Chinese, you’ll rent a movie, artsy but accessible, then light petting, no coitus."
4474,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Sounds fun.
4475,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"I’ll leave the details up to you, I think it’s better if you assume the male role."
4476,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Thank you, that’s very thoughtful."
4477,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,Great. Call me.
4478,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Great news. My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.
4479,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Terrific.
4480,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"You know what this means, don’t you? Break out the Red Bull, it’s time to rock Mario old school."
4481,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,I kind of have other plans tonight.
4482,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"But it’s Friday. Friday’s always vintage game night. Look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia."
4483,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Well, the thing is, someone’s coming over."
4484,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Well then, no problem, I have three controllers, the more the merrier."
4485,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s a date, I have a date coming over."
4486,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Oh, well you can’t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion."
4487,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Why, what’s so unusual about me having a date?"
4488,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Well, statistically speaking…"
4489,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce."
4490,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can’t be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?"
4491,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?"
4492,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,You want me to leave the apartment?
4493,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Yes.
4494,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,You mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else?
4495,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Yes.
4496,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too."
4497,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way."
4498,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Well alright then.
4499,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,Sheldon? What are you doing?
4500,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.
4501,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?"
4502,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"I’m a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date."
4503,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don’t you just go to a movie or something?"
4504,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Alone?
4505,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Yeah, why not?"
4506,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre."
4507,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,Well then don’t order popcorn.
4508,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,No popcorn at the mo… listen to yourself.
4509,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,Well why don’t you go to a coffee shop.
4510,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,I don’t drink coffee.
4511,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,They have other things.
4512,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,What do they have?
4513,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"I don’t know, you know, cookies, pastries…"
4514,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Pastries such as bearclaws?
4515,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Yeah, sure."
4516,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,I don’t like bearclaws.
4517,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,Heya Penny. Dumbass.
4518,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?"
4519,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they’re both scientists."
4520,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.
4521,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya."
4522,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing, I’m just enabling you."
4523,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,This is pretty good Orange Chicken.
4524,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s from Changs."
4525,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,Not Chows?
4526,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"No, Changs."
4527,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,What happened to Chows?
4528,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,It changed.
4529,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"Oh. So, how many children do you think we should have?"
4530,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"I’m sorry, that was a little abrupt."
4531,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,A little.
4532,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,I mean there are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction.
4533,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,I sure hope so.
4534,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?"
4535,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"I’m sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue."
4536,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"Uh, genetic weaknesses, right, um, there’s the lactose intolerance."
4537,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Don’t forget the male pattern baldness. When his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs.
4538,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So… Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me."
4539,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,What now?
4540,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,I have to make pee-pee.
4541,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Listen, I’m sorry about all of Sheldon’s interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric."
4542,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"If by eccentric you mean passive-aggressive East Texas blowhole, I agree."
4543,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Well, I think tonight was a very good start."
4544,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,Me too. You’re sure you’re okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test?
4545,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"No problem, I’m very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I’ll call you and we’ll arrange another evening."
4546,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,Yes. I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I’m not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.
4547,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Sure.
4548,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"Again, it’s your decision, you’re the man."
4549,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"No, it wasn’t my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrodinger."
4550,2,2,the codpiece topology,Eric,From the Charlie Brown cartoons?
4551,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonard."
4552,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Hello.
4553,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,Leslie.
4554,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,Hi.
4555,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Okay, well, goodnight."
4556,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Okay, well, goodnight."
4557,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,That ain’t going to make your point.
4558,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"Okay, that’s enough."
4559,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,Call me
4560,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Right
4561,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Okay, goodnight."
4562,2,2,the codpiece topology,Eric,What?
4563,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Had a great time, ciao"
4564,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair."
4565,2,2,the codpiece topology,Howard,"Come on, Sheldon, there’s so few places I can wear my jester costume."
4566,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,I don’t care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
4567,2,2,the codpiece topology,Raj,"Oh, okay, how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s."
4568,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,You mean like Spock?
4569,2,2,the codpiece topology,Raj,Sure.
4570,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Fascinating.
4571,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,Hey fellow scientists. Sheldon.
4572,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Hey, why don’t we all move over there so Leslie can join us."
4573,2,2,the codpiece topology,Howard,"Hmm, let’s do it."
4574,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"If you’re having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology."
4575,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Don’t make this hard for me.
4576,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"It’s not hard. It’s simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with."
4577,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"You’re right, it is simple."
4578,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
4579,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Penny.
4580,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,Third floor tonight. Mixing it up?
4581,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Oh. You know, I still don’t understand why you just don’t go to dinner or something."
4582,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Alright, let’s say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone’s not touching my food?"
4583,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,Goodnight Sheldon.
4584,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can’t work out with you and Leonard?"
4585,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,Excuse me?
4586,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,I’m just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?
4587,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Okay, where is this coming from?"
4588,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.
4589,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,Your arch enemy?
4590,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel."
4591,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it."
4592,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Do you know, it’s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out."
4593,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Sheldon, come back, you’re losing me."
4594,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research."
4595,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Oh, sweetie, I’m sorry."
4596,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,She called me dumbass.
4597,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,I know. I heard.
4598,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard."
4599,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends."
4600,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"No, that response is unacceptable to me."
4601,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know…"
4602,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Smart? I’d have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.
4603,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,Are you going to let me talk?
4604,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,I’m sorry.
4605,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it."
4606,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.
4607,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,"Okay, let me put it this way, if you’re really Leonard’s friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with."
4608,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard’s really my friend, why doesn’t he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?"
4609,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,Because love trumps hate.
4610,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Oh now you’re just making stuff up.
4611,2,2,the codpiece topology,Penny,Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.
4612,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop."
4613,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,When the two of you reach a natural stopping point I’d like to have a word.
4614,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"If the word is pee-pee, just do it."
4615,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie."
4616,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Thank you.
4617,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun."
4618,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,Hang on a second. Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.
4619,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"I’m listening, amuse me."
4620,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"Okay, well, for one thing we expect quantii space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colours."
4621,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
4622,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,Are you going to let him talk to me like that?
4623,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories."
4624,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"No there isn’t, only loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes."
4625,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Sheldon, don’t make that noise, it’s disrespectful."
4626,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"I hope so, it was a snort of derision."
4627,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"You agree with me, right, loop quantum gravity is the future of physics."
4628,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy."
4629,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"Well, I’m glad I found out the truth about you before this went any further."
4630,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Truth, what truth? We’re talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it’s no big deal."
4631,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"Oh, it isn’t, really? Tell me Leonard, how would we raise the children?"
4632,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,I guess we let them wait until they’re old enough and let them choose their own theory.
4633,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"We can’t let them choose, Leonard, they’re children."
4634,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Wait, where are you going?"
4635,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leslie,"I’m sorry, I could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice-cream or ever get a good view of a parade, but this? This is a deal breaker."
4636,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Look on the bright side.
4637,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,What’s the bright side?
4638,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,Only nine more months to comic-con.
4639,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,Oh yeah.
4640,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,"Captain, I’m getting an unusual reading."
4641,2,2,the codpiece topology,Leonard,"Yeah, that’s great, you guys want corn dogs?"
4642,2,2,the codpiece topology,Howard,Yeah.
4643,2,2,the codpiece topology,Sheldon,That’s a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didn’t come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.
4644,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Axel’s fortress. Now this is a long run, so let’s do another bladder check. Alright Barry, we’ll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor."
4645,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?"
4646,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Yes, I can’t get my stupid door open."
4647,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"You appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?"
4648,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,Yeah!
4649,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Alright then.
4650,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit."
4651,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?
4652,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,I can’t get the damned key out.
4653,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Well that’s not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system."
4654,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Thankyou, Sheldon."
4655,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"You’re welcome. Point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?"
4656,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Why? I’ll tell you why. Because today I had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?"
4657,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who, well they have a characteristic facial bone structure…."
4658,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"I know what it means, Sheldon! God, you know, I have been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I haven’t got a single acting job, I have accomplished nothing, haven’t gotten a raise at work, haven’t even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it."
4659,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, they’re almost pure protein."
4660,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Oh, sonofabitch!"
4661,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you."
4662,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"I did, and he said he’ll get here when he gets here."
4663,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,And you’re frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?
4664,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly.
4665,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,There there.
4666,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?
4667,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"No Sheldon, I’d rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old."
4668,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Alright then.
4669,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,For God’s sake!
4670,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Just when I think I’ve gotten the hang of sarcasm.
4671,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Make yourself comfortable.
4672,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Not there.
4673,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,Sheldor?
4674,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,The Conqueror.
4675,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,What are you doing?
4676,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"AFK. I’m playing Age of Conan, an online multiplayer game set in the universe of Robert E. Howard’s Conan the Barbarian."
4677,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,Oh.
4678,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Sheldor, back online."
4679,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,What’s AFK?
4680,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,AFK. Away from keyboard.
4681,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,OIC.
4682,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,What does that stand for?
4683,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Oh, I see?"
4684,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Yes, but what does it stand for?"
4685,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.
4686,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Oh, I don’t know. Can I see them in another colour?"
4687,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Just click on them. Congratulations, you are now a level three warrior."
4688,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,What’s going on?
4689,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Leonard, guess what, I’m a level three warrior."
4690,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"Great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?"
4691,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Yeah yeah yeah, shhh!"
4692,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it’s starting to attract wildlife.
4693,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?"
4694,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"It doesn’t matter, right now you’re looking for treasure."
4695,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,Okay.
4696,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Wait, wait, where are you going?"
4697,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"You’re okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots."
4698,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,Want to catch me up?
4699,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Well let’s see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly Midwestern, um, she hasn’t had sex in six months, and she ate a fly."
4700,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?"
4701,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Oh my God, a treasure chest, I’m rich!"
4702,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Level three and she thinks she’s rich! What a noob.
4703,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Raj,"Okay, we’re all set."
4704,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Howard,Let her rip.
4705,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,Hi!
4706,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"Hey, check it out, it’s just corn starch and water."
4707,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker."
4708,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Howard,That’s what makes it get all funky.
4709,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Yeah, okay. Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon."
4710,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Howard,"No, that’s what she said, Sheldon."
4711,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Okay, look, I bought the game, and I’ve been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can’t figure out how to get past the guard captain."
4712,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Do you have the enchanted sword?
4713,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"No, no, I’ve a bronze dagger."
4714,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"You can’t slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger, my Lord it’s like the car key in your apartment door all over again."
4715,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?"
4716,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Well, have you been to the Temple of Mithra?"
4717,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?
4718,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"No, no, no, it’s… oh for God’s sakes, gimme."
4719,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Thank you, I really appreciate this."
4720,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"You’re going to have to learn to do these things for yourself, Penny."
4721,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Don’t patronise me, just get the sword."
4722,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Howard,What the frak?
4723,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,Beats me. They were playing all last night too.
4724,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Raj,It’s like some kind of weird comic book crossover.
4725,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Howard,Like if Hulk were dating Peppermint Patty.
4726,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Raj,I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?
4727,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"No, that’s Marcie. Peppermint Patty’s just athletic."
4728,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"There you go, one enchanted sword."
4729,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard captain."
4730,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,That girl needs to get a life.
4731,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,Sheldon.
4732,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,Shel-don.
4733,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Danger, danger."
4734,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"No danger, look, it’s just me, Penny, look, I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?"
4735,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,You’re in my bedroom.
4736,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.
4737,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,People can’t be in my bedroom.
4738,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?"
4739,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,I’m not wearing pyjama bottoms.
4740,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,Why not?
4741,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,I spilled grape juice.
4742,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Well, wear different pyjamas."
4743,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"I can’t wear different pyjamas, these are my Monday pyjamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom."
4744,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?"
4745,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?
4746,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, I’m just not sure it’s the right move for my character."
4747,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Of course it’s not, you’re only a level 25, the Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder."
4748,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Really? Boy, you’d think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians."
4749,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Please Penny, enough, I have to sleep."
4750,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Okay, well you were great, thanks."
4751,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Oh, hey Leonard, listen, don’t got in Sheldon’s room, he’s not wearing bottoms."
4752,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"Sheldon, you want to catch me up again?"
4753,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Gablehauser,"People, I am very busy today."
4754,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"I realise that Dr Gablehauser but it is your job, as head of the department, to mediate all inter-departmental disputes. University policy manual chapter four, subsection two, mediation of inter-departmental disputes."
4755,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Gablehauser,"Fine. Dr Winkle, what colourful name did you call Dr Cooper this time?"
4756,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leslie,Dr Dumbass.
4757,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Gablehauser,"Dr Cooper, Dr Winkle apologises."
4758,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,No she doesn’t.
4759,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leslie,No I don’t.
4760,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Here’s the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204, and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall."
4761,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leslie,It wasn’t even an official sign-up sheet. He printed it himself and he put his name down in every slot for the next six months.
4762,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty.
4763,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Oh, Penny!"
4764,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Gablehauser,You need to get that Dr Cooper?
4765,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"God, no."
4766,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leslie,"Well don’t turn it off, you might miss your call from the Nobel committee letting you know you’ve been nominated as dumbass laureate of the year."
4767,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Oh yeah, well, you wouldn’t even be nominated. Dr Gablehauser, I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. All she’s doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock…"
4768,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Gablehauser,Excuse me. Gablehauser.
4769,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Gablehauser,It’s for you.
4770,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Hello. Penny, this is not a good time. No, I told you, you’re not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls. You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one should be a level 35 healer. Penny, I can’t log on and help you. We’ll talk when I get home."
4771,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"I’m not getting the computing time, am I?"
4772,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leslie,Dumbass.
4773,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep, she’s interfering with my work, and if I had another significant aspect of my life, I’m sure she’d be interfering with that too."
4774,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"Why should I do something, you’re the one who introduced her to online gaming."
4775,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Well, yes, but you’re the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you’d simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening."
4776,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,Why don’t you just tell her to leave you alone.
4777,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"I did. I told her, I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter. I even changed my facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I don’t know what else to do."
4778,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"Well, what am I supposed to do?"
4779,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"I don’t know, but if you don’t figure something out, I warn you I shall become very difficult to live with."
4780,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"You mean, up until now we’ve been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon?"
4781,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Yes.
4782,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,I’ll go talk to her.
4783,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"No, Fritz, I need you on my flank. No, I don’t know German. Flankenzie, flankenzie!"
4784,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,Hey Penny.
4785,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,Busy.
4786,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"Yeah, I see that. Shouldn’t you be at work?"
4787,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,I don’t work on Mondays.
4788,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"It’s Thursday. Listen, Penny."
4789,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?"
4790,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"Okay, um, here’s the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted."
4791,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Yeah, get to the point, I’m about to level up here."
4792,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"Well, i-i-i-it’s just if a person doesn’t have a sense of achievement in their real life it’s easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment."
4793,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope’s back online."
4794,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"Penny, you’ve got cheetos in your hair."
4795,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Oh, thanks."
4796,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,Wow.
4797,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Warrior,"Hey Penny, it’s me again, Leonard."
4798,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny- warrior,"Leonard, I said not now."
4799,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard-warrior,"Yeah, I know, I’m just a little concerned about you."
4800,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny-warrior,I said not now.
4801,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard-warrior’s head,"Okay, maybe later."
4802,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Raj,Hey guys.
4803,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard and Howard,Hey.
4804,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Raj,"Hey, what’s with him?"
4805,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,Penny’s been keeping him up at night.
4806,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Howard,Me too. But probably in a different way.
4807,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"She’s gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, she’s playing non-stop."
4808,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Raj,"Ah, yes, online gaming addiction. There’s nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back."
4809,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"Sheldon, wake up."
4810,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Danger, danger."
4811,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leslie,Afternoon men. Sheldon.
4812,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Oh yeah, well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males…. oh, I’m too tired to do this."
4813,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leslie,"Right, I heard you’ve been pulling all nighters with middle-earth Barbie."
4814,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,She comes into my room. No-one’s supposed to be in my room.
4815,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leslie,"Well, I would postulate that she’s escaping into the online world to compensate for her sexual frustration."
4816,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Howard,I do that too. But probably in a different way.
4817,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"That’s not what she’s doing, Leslie, she’s just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex."
4818,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leslie,Everything has to do with sex.
4819,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Howard,"Mmmm, testify."
4820,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leslie,I’m not touching that.
4821,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"Leslie, you are way off base here."
4822,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness."
4823,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leslie,Thank you. My point is that Tinkerbell just needs to get her some.
4824,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse."
4825,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Howard,I’ll take the bullet.
4826,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"Excuse me, this whole idea is insane."
4827,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Yeah, yeah, enough debate, I’m going to take action."
4828,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?"
4829,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Man,No.
4830,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Would you like to be?
4831,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Man,"Uh, sure, why not?"
4832,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,Sheldon…
4833,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Zip it pip it. Can I have your phone number?
4834,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Man,Uh…
4835,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Man,"Yeah, yeah."
4836,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"There, problem solved."
4837,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leslie,Dumbass.
4838,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Okay, I’m at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, I’m going in."
4839,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.
4840,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,Got it.
4841,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"I must say, you’re playing very well for a woman of 23?"
4842,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,22.
4843,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Right. 22.
4844,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?"
4845,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,What happened to the rest of your group?
4846,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"I dumped them, they’re a bunch of wussies."
4847,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Frenzy stance.
4848,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!"
4849,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?"
4850,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,What?
4851,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,These are market research questions. I’m filling out the online registration for your game.
4852,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn’t working, die you undead mummy, die!"
4853,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Drink a healing potion.
4854,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,Thank you.
4855,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"You’re welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?"
4856,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,That’s on the registration?
4857,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Oh yes, it’s quite extensive. But if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests."
4858,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate I’m a big old five."
4859,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Good to know. Big old five.
4860,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,Hello.
4861,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Man,Hi.
4862,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Leonard, this is Tom."
4863,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn’t I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?
4864,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny."
4865,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,Chosen by science?
4866,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum."
4867,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,You got Penny to sign up for online dating?
4868,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"No, of course not. No, I used trickery and deceit."
4869,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,This is bad.
4870,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he’s going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and, uh, strong women who initiate sex."
4871,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,"Really, really bad."
4872,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,I’m surprised you struck out with Penny. Apparently she’s a big old five.
4873,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Sheldon, what do you want."
4874,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"Oh, good, you got my note. Penny, I’d like you to meet Tom, uh, Penny, this is Tom, Tom, may I present Penny."
4875,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Tom,Hi Penny.
4876,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as I’m here, I’m on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don’t know what they’re doing, we’ve got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank."
4877,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,Can we talk about this later.
4878,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"No, no, no, no, I need you now."
4879,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Sheldon,"But wouldn’t you prefer to socialise with Tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman."
4880,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Whatever, I’ll figure it out myself."
4881,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Tom,"Bye, Penny. I’m sorry, dude, she didn’t look anything like her picture."
4882,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Leonard,They never do.
4883,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Warrior,"Hello, fair Penny."
4884,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny-warrior,Who are you?
4885,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Warrior,"It is I, Sir Howard of Wolowitz. Can I interest you in an afternoon of spirited questing, followed by a flagon of ale at yon virtual tavern?"
4886,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny-warrior,"Yeah, sure, why not?"
4887,2,3,the barbarian sublimation,Penny,"Oh my God, I need help."
4888,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"Let’s see, Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken."
4889,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,I’m the dumplings.
4890,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"Yes, you are."
4891,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Creepy, Howard."
4892,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,Creepy good or creepy bad?
4893,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?
4894,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"That would be me. Come to Poppa, you un-kosher delight."
4895,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,I’m not necessarily talking to the food.
4896,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,Sit over there.
4897,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,Sit over there. Baby wipe?
4898,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,What do you have….
4899,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard and Howard together,Don’t! Don’t! Don’t!
4900,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,I’ll tell you why.
4901,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard and Howard,O-o-o-oh!
4902,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.
4903,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,I thought the blowers were more sanitary?
4904,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard and Howard,Why? Don’t!
4905,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.
4906,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Hey guys, I just got the most amazing new…"
4907,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Gosh, Raj, do you think you’ll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk?"
4908,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Okay, well, I’ll just, um, go eat by myself."
4909,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"Penny, you don’t have to do that."
4910,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"No, it’s okay, between"
4911,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"him not talking,"
4912,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,him talking and…
4913,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"him, I’m better off alone, so,"
4914,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,goodbye you poor strange little man
4915,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,She’s so considerate.
4916,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,So what’s your news?
4917,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,Remember that little planetary object I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?
4918,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"Oh yeah, two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen."
4919,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Or as I called it, Planet Bollywood. Anyway, because of my discovery, People magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch."
4920,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard and Howard together,"Well, wow, that’s incredible."
4921,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?"
4922,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.
4923,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that.
4924,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"It’s pretty cool, they’ve got me in with a guy who’s doing something about hunger in Indonesia, and a psychotherapist who’s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the charming independent film Juno."
4925,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"Oh, I’d so do her."
4926,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,You’d do the dolphins.
4927,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,Do I get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.
4928,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Sorry, it’s not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars."
4929,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"Poverty? Your father’s a gynaecologist, he drives a Bentley."
4930,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,It’s a lease.
4931,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,I’m confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?
4932,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,Peer review? It’s People magazine. People picked me.
4933,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,What people?
4934,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,The people from People.
4935,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that’s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?"
4936,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Boy, I bet Ellen Pages friends aren’t giving her this kind of crap."
4937,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Are you proud of yourself?
4938,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"In general, yes."
4939,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Oh, there’s my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren’t you, you little subatomic Dickens?"
4940,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Hi Sheldon.
4941,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino."
4942,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons."
4943,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"Well, we’re going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner."
4944,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Apologise, for what?"
4945,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren’t very supportive."
4946,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,I sense you’re trying to tell me something.
4947,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,You were a colossal ass-hat.
4948,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive."
4949,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"Really, do tell."
4950,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a “world’s greatest dad” coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died."
4951,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"Okay, let’s try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?"
4952,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,I had not considered that.
4953,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Come on.
4954,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,I often forget other people have limitations. It’s so sad.
4955,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,He can feel sadness?
4956,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"Not really, it’s what you and I would call condescension."
4957,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"And when we go in there, let’s show Raj that we’re happy for him."
4958,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,But I’m not.
4959,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"Well then fake it. Look at me, I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but I’m bigger than that."
4960,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Fine, what do you want me to do?"
4961,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Smile.
4962,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"Oh crap, that’s terrifying."
4963,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"We’re here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman."
4964,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,Try less teeth.
4965,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"Close enough, come on."
4966,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Hi Raj.
4967,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Hey guys, what’s up?"
4968,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,We just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight.
4969,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. Right Sheldon?
4970,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"It’s very nice of you, I would like that."
4971,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Gablehauser,Hello boys.
4972,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,Dr Gablehouser.
4973,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Gablehauser,Dr Koothrappali.
4974,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Dr Gablehauser.
4975,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Gablehauser,Dr Hoffstadter.
4976,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,Dr Gablehauser.
4977,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Gablehauser,Dr Cooper.
4978,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,Dr Gablehauser.
4979,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Gablehauser,"Mister Wolowitz. Boys, I’ve got a question for you. Who in this room discovered a star?"
4980,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Actually, 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body."
4981,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Gablehauser,"I’m not talking about you, I’m talking about me. You, my exotic young friend are my star."
4982,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Well, you didn’t discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17."
4983,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Sheldon!
4984,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Oh, sorry."
4985,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Gablehauser,"Well, we’ve got to get you into a better office, something more suited to your status."
4986,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Really, you don’t have to go to any trouble."
4987,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Gablehauser,How about if I put you in Von Gerlick’s old office?
4988,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"I’d rather have Fishbine’s, it’s bigger."
4989,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Gablehauser,Done.
4990,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"Wait a minute, I called dibs on Fishbine’s office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe."
4991,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"He gets a new office, I can’t even get paper towels in the men’s room?"
4992,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Sheldon.
4993,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Damn, this is hard."
4994,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Gablehauser,"Let me ask you something, what do you think the business of this place is?"
4995,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Science?
4996,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Gablehauser,Money.
4997,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,Told you.
4998,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Gablehauser,"And this boy’s picture in People magazine is going to raise us a pile of money taller than… well, taller than you"
4999,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,I have a master’s degree.
5000,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Gablehauser,"Who doesn’t? Dr Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch in the President’s dining room?"
5001,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,I didn’t even know there was a President’s dining room.
5002,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Gablehauser,"It’s the same food as the Cafeteria, only fresh. Come on little buddy."
5003,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Okay, big buddy. See you tonight guys."
5004,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,You can stop smiling now.
5005,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,Aaaah!
5006,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"So anyway, after a fantastic lunch I was whisked off to the People magazine photo shoot… have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?"
5007,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,No.
5008,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"It’s fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this."
5009,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"They’re going to digitally add a supernova, they say it’s the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent."
5010,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself."
5011,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Excuse me. Oh, it’s my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh."
5012,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.
5013,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,Have we at this point met our social obligations?
5014,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Not yet.
5015,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can’t go, alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy, I don’t know what I’d do without him."
5016,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,You just got him this afternoon.
5017,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Yes, but I’m finding that having a lackey suits me."
5018,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,A lackey?
5019,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Oh, I’m sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables."
5020,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,Now?
5021,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Almost.
5022,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Speaking of untouchables, I’ve got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited."
5023,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"Oh, gee, thanks."
5024,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Oh, you’re welcome. Of course, I couldn’t get you into the VIP section, because, you know, that’s for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps."
5025,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"There’s a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point."
5026,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Here you go, Raj, you might want to drink this one slowly."
5027,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Okay, so, Saturday night, can I count on my posse?"
5028,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"Gee, I’d love to Raj, but I can’t make it."
5029,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Oh, okay, Leonard?"
5030,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"Well, uh, no I… the… no."
5031,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,Sheldon?
5032,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"I can make it, but I won’t."
5033,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,What are you guys talking about?
5034,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Well, there’s a reception for my magazine article on Saturday."
5035,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"And you guys aren’t going? I can’t believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you’re not even going to be there to support him?"
5036,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.
5037,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,That would be cool. I’d go to that reception.
5038,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Come on, this is huge, Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didn’t even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters."
5039,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,Would you like to go with me?
5040,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Of course I would, I would be honoured."
5041,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,Really? Cool.
5042,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,Shame on you guys.
5043,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I can’t believe it took you a whole year.
5044,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,Now?
5045,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Now.
5046,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Hey, buddy. I’m going to be in people magazine."
5047,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Charlie Sheen,"Yeah, call me when you’re on the cover."
5048,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Oh, Raj, look at you!"
5049,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?"
5050,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren’t you?"
5051,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here, sip on this while you’re getting ready."
5052,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Oh, I’m ready."
5053,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,That’s what you’re wearing.
5054,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Um, yeah, why what’s wrong with it?"
5055,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Nothing, I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous."
5056,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Yeah, well, this is all the donkulous you’re gonna get."
5057,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Okey dokey, let’s roll. Alright, it’s time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh, oo-ooh."
5058,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,Hey Leonard.
5059,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Hey.
5060,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,Dude.
5061,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,You look very nice.
5062,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj and Penny together,Thank you.
5063,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Uh, come on, good night Leonard."
5064,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Good night.
5065,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Hey, Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs."
5066,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Yeah.
5067,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,It’s bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.
5068,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Terrific.
5069,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,It has more food too.
5070,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Alright, come on, come on."
5071,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,I’m coming up so you better get this party started.
5072,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Hey.
5073,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"Hey, good news, you don’t have to sulk about Penny any more, look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them."
5074,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Anythingforagreencard.com?
5075,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"I’ll lend you my user name, it’s wealthybigpenis."
5076,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,You’re joking.
5077,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"Well, you gotta make it easy for them, they’re just learning English."
5078,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Pass.
5079,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,So you’re just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Doctor Apu from the Kwik-e-Mart?
5080,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"It’s not a date, and that’s racist."
5081,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"It can’t be racist, he’s a beloved character on the Simpsons."
5082,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Let’s just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.
5083,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?
5084,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Yes.
5085,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
5086,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Yes.
5087,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Brown rice, not white?"
5088,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Yes.
5089,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.
5090,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Yes.
5091,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?
5092,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Yes.
5093,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,Thank you.
5094,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,You’re welcome.
5095,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,What took you so long?
5096,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Just sit down and eat.
5097,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,Fine.
5098,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"Alright, it’s shredded, what do you want me to do?"
5099,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,I want you to check before you accept the order.
5100,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Sorry.
5101,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?
5102,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,He’s not going to have intercourse with Penny.
5103,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Then there’s no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood."
5104,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle."
5105,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"That’s Northwest Texas, I’m from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers."
5106,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,Do the shrimpers feature in your story?
5107,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky."
5108,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,Lucky?
5109,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Yes, Lucky."
5110,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"He’s irony impaired, just move on."
5111,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"Okay, dead cat named Lucky, continue."
5112,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command."
5113,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"So, not a puppy?"
5114,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin."
5115,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,A griffin?
5116,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Yes, half eagle, half lion."
5117,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,And mythological.
5118,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them."
5119,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"Sheldon, not that we don’t all enjoy a good lion semen story, what’s your point."
5120,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort."
5121,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,You want to breed a new friend?
5122,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"That’s one option, but who has the time? But consider this, the Japanese, they’re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney, next thing you know, we’re playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln."
5123,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"Sheldon, don’t take this the wrong way, but, you’re insane."
5124,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn’t kill us to meet some new people."
5125,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,"Uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and I’m not insane, my mother had me tested."
5126,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back."
5127,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,"And he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties."
5128,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Sheldon,He should share our love of technology.
5129,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Howard,And he should know a lot of women.
5130,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Leonard,"Yeah, let’s see, money, women, technology, okay we’re agreed, our new friend is going to be Iron Man."
5131,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,Welcome to the Raj Mahal.
5132,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Yes, it’s very nice, goodnight Raj."
5133,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"No, wait, the evening’s not over."
5134,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,Yes it is.
5135,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"No, it’s time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face."
5136,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Oh, wow, is the evening over."
5137,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Wait, wait, that’s my mummy and daddy calling from India. I want you to meet my parents."
5138,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Wait, meet them."
5139,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Hello mummy and daddy, good to see you. I’m not drunk."
5140,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Mrs Koothrappali,Why would you say that?
5141,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Just making conversation. Mummy, daddy, I want you to meet my new squeeze, Penny."
5142,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.
5143,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Dr Koothrappali,"I can’t see her, centre her in the frame."
5144,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Here you go, cute huh?"
5145,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Mrs Koothrappali,She’s not Indian.
5146,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Dr Koothrappali,"So, she’s not Indian, the boy’s just sowing some wild oats."
5147,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"No, no, there’s no sowing, no squeezing, and no sucking face."
5148,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Mrs Koothrappali,What if he gets her pregnant. Is this little hotsy-totsy who you want as the mother of your grandchildren.
5149,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?
5150,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Dr Koothrappali,"Look, Rajesh, I understand, you’re in America, you want to try the local cuisine. But trust me, you don’t want it for a steady diet."
5151,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,"Now you listen to me, I am no longer a child, and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you’d excuse me, I have to go throw up."
5152,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Mrs Koothrappali,What’s wrong with him?
5153,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"I don’t know, maybe it’s the local cuisine. Okay, well, it’s nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I’m going to leave so, Namaste."
5154,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"And FYI, you’d be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law."
5155,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Dr Koothrappali,She’s feisty. I like that.
5156,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Raj, what are you doing."
5157,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"No. No notes. If you have something to say to me, say it."
5158,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Raj,Sorry.
5159,2,4,the griffin equivalency,Penny,"Oh, sweetie, it’s okay."
5160,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Good morning, Leonard."
5161,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,Uh-huh.
5162,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Yeah, we’re going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night’s sleep. I don’t like the way Darth Vader stares at me."
5163,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,I’m not going to work.
5164,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, just because your career’s been stagnant for a few years, that’s no reason to give up."
5165,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment."
5166,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?
5167,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,No.
5168,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Then you can drive. Let’s go.
5169,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Didn’t I tell you I’d be working nights, and that you’d have to make other arrangements."
5170,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,You did.
5171,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,And?
5172,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,I didn’t. Let’s go.
5173,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Goodnight, Sheldon."
5174,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,But how am I going to get to work?
5175,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,Take the bus.
5176,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,I can’t take the bus any more. They don’t have seatbelts. And they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.
5177,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
5178,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"I didn’t try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus."
5179,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Oh, you’re a big boy, you’ll figure it out."
5180,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Don’t talk to me like I’m a child. Now, take me to return my star wars sheets!"
5181,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny…"
5182,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"Sheldon, what is it?"
5183,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Leonard’s asleep.
5184,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,Thanks for the update
5185,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"No, wait. You have to drive me to work."
5186,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"Yeah, uh, I really don’t think I do."
5187,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"But I don’t drive, and I can’t take the bus."
5188,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"Yeah, honey, you’ll be fine as long as you don’t do that bungee cord thing, okay?"
5189,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Penny. Didn’t you recently state that you and I are friends?
5190,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"Yes, Sheldon, we are friends."
5191,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Then I hereby invoke what I’m given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favour.
5192,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"Oh, dear God."
5193,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you’re done, we’ll go."
5194,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Thank you for driving me to work.
5195,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"You know this is my day off, Sheldon."
5196,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, good. I’m not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on."
5197,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,Mm-hmm.
5198,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Typically that’s an indicator. To, you know, check your engine."
5199,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"It’s fine, it’s been on for, like, a month."
5200,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine."
5201,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"Sheldon, it’s fine."
5202,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"If it were fine, the light wouldn’t be on. That’s why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it’s not fine."
5203,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"Uh, maybe the light’s broken."
5204,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Is there a “check the check engine light light”?
5205,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,O-o-o-oh!
5206,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,What?
5207,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one’s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol."
5208,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,Do you have any alcohol?
5209,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Of course not.
5210,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,Too bad.
5211,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,You’re going up Euclid Avenue?
5212,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,Mm-hmm.
5213,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.
5214,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"Well, good for Leonard."
5215,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if you’re not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Here’s a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?"
5216,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,No.
5217,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"The answer’s tricky. It’s Second Street. You see, you’d think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds  with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?"
5218,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,No.
5219,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, come on, it’s fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I’ll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I’ll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh.  Very clever, that’s a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium, you say Manganese, and  I say Europium, and, and you’re left with Mendelevium, and  there are no more M’s because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?"
5220,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,How about we just have a little quiet time now?
5221,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"All right. Hmm, huh, I’m sorry, I’m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling."
5222,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,Get out.
5223,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, I’m not sure I’m capable of performing diagnostics."
5224,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"I said, get out."
5225,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Okay. I’ll give it a shot.
5226,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, there you are, I’m ready to go home."
5227,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,I just got here.
5228,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Good, perfect timing."
5229,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can’t drive you for the next few weeks."
5230,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"No, you said you couldn’t drive me to work, this is from work."
5231,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Howard, help me out here."
5232,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,"No, just for the fun of it, I’m gonna take his side."
5233,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Now, how do you propose I get home?"
5234,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,How did you get here in the first place?
5235,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Penny. But I sense that’s no longer an option.
5236,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Look, I need to get to the laser lab, you’re just going to have to find someone else to take you home."
5237,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,"Oh damn, I picked the wrong side."
5238,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God, not Euclid Avenue! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
5239,2,5,the euclid alternative,Raj,Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?
5240,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,We had a difference of opinion.
5241,2,5,the euclid alternative,Raj,Over what?
5242,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?"
5243,2,5,the euclid alternative,Raj,I’m taking you home.
5244,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, but I’m not going home. It’s Wednesday, Wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it’s creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, there’s a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets."
5245,2,5,the euclid alternative,Raj,I have a better idea.
5246,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,You want to go to pottery barn first?
5247,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Can you drive me to Pottery Barn?
5248,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Maybe if I turn off the night-light, I can keep the sheets."
5249,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Good morning.
5250,2,5,the euclid alternative,All,Good morning.
5251,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Sheldon, sit down."
5252,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"She’s in my spot. Don’t look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot."
5253,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"Sheldon, you know  that we care about you."
5254,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,And it’s because we care about you that we’ve decided we have to speak up.
5255,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"You’re hurting the people around you, sweetie."
5256,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it."
5257,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don’t have a problem.
5258,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive."
5259,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,This madness has to stop.
5260,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Penny’s taking you to the DMV, I’m going to bed."
5261,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Why Penny?
5262,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight."
5263,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"All right, come on Sheldon."
5264,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Hold on, I have one condition."
5265,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,What?
5266,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,We have to stop at Pottery Barn.
5267,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,Okay.
5268,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,And Radio Shack.
5269,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,Fine.
5270,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,And the comic book store.
5271,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,All right!
5272,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,"Ooh, I want to go to the comic book store."
5273,2,5,the euclid alternative,Raj,I like comic books.
5274,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"I just don’t see why I need a driver’s license, Albert Einstein never had a driver’s license."
5275,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,"Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn’t make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour."
5276,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn’t you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?"
5277,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,I was otherwise engaged.
5278,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,Doing what?
5279,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.
5280,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"Well, how ’bout when you were 17?"
5281,2,5,the euclid alternative,DMV Lady,"Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!"
5282,2,5,the euclid alternative,DMV Lady,Application?
5283,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,I’m actually more of a theorist.
5284,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,"The application in your hand, give it to her."
5285,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Oh.
5286,2,5,the euclid alternative,DMV Lady,"Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!"
5287,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions."
5288,2,5,the euclid alternative,DMV Lady,Look at that sign up there.
5289,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Yes?
5290,2,5,the euclid alternative,DMV Lady,Does it say I give a damn?
5291,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,No.
5292,2,5,the euclid alternative,DMV Lady,That’s because I don’t.
5293,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? There’s no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure."
5294,2,5,the euclid alternative,DMV Lady,Look at the sign.
5295,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"Sheldon, it’s C, just put down C."
5296,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"I don’t need your help, Penny."
5297,2,5,the euclid alternative,DMV Lady,"Listen to that little girl, honey, put C. Next!"
5298,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question."
5299,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,"Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?"
5300,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction."
5301,2,5,the euclid alternative,DMV Lady,Here’s your learner’s permit. Go away.
5302,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,But I’m not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.
5303,2,5,the euclid alternative,DMV Lady,Don’t make me climb over this counter.
5304,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"Come on, let’s go."
5305,2,5,the euclid alternative,DMV Lady,Next!
5306,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Aced it.
5307,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,"Okay, that’s it, let’s boot it up."
5308,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,Booting.
5309,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,This is a state-of-the-art simulator. I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.
5310,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?"
5311,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,I haven’t configured it yet. Let’s see… Bradley tank… transport truck…  Batmobile…
5312,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Ooh!
5313,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,No.
5314,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,"Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena."
5315,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Hmmmm?
5316,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,What?
5317,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. I don’t want any hassles with the fuzz."
5318,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,"Fine, what colour do you want?"
5319,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?"
5320,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,Black it is.
5321,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive."
5322,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,I haven’t fastened my seat belt yet.
5323,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Okay, fasten your seat belt."
5324,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Click. Now, are there air bags?"
5325,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,You don’t need air bags.
5326,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,What if a simulated van rear-ends me?
5327,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,I’ll hit you in the face with a pillow.
5328,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic."
5329,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,Oh.
5330,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,Oh.
5331,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,Oh.
5332,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,Watch out.
5333,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,Oh God!
5334,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!"
5335,2,5,the euclid alternative,Penny,"Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!"
5336,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Thank you.
5337,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Sorry… excuse me… my bad… student driver…
5338,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?
5339,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"I don’t know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another."
5340,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.
5341,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,No. I quit.
5342,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Aw, the pet store?"
5343,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it’s amazingly detailed."
5344,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"So wait,you’re just gonna give up?"
5345,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"No, I’m not giving up, I never give up."
5346,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,So what is it you’re doing?
5347,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,I’m transcending the situation. I’m clearly too evolved for driving.
5348,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,What does that mean?
5349,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?"
5350,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not… not that."
5351,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Well, those are indicators that I’m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human."
5352,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,No kidding.
5353,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Well, no, no, I’m not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a Homo Novus, if you will, no, that’s for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I’m not meant to."
5354,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Yes, you are, you’re meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!"
5355,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"No, no. Leonard, I’m meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it’s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road."
5356,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,It’s never safe.
5357,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Yeah, well, I know that now."
5358,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?"
5359,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,Homo Novus doesn’t know.
5360,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Well, hang in there, maybe you’ll evolve into something with wings."
5361,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,"Good morning, gentlemen."
5362,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,Hey.
5363,2,5,the euclid alternative,Raj,Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don’t know about?
5364,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"No, he lives here now."
5365,2,5,the euclid alternative,Howard,Really? Why?
5366,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,"Well, since he won’t take the bus and he’s too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I’m finished with my experiment."
5367,2,5,the euclid alternative,Raj,But you finished your experiment a week ago.
5368,2,5,the euclid alternative,Leonard,Yep
5369,2,5,the euclid alternative,Cleaning Lady 2,"Oh my God, again?"
5370,2,5,the euclid alternative,Cleaning Lady 2,It must be rats.
5371,2,5,the euclid alternative,Cleaning Lady 1,Rats don’t make toast and cut off the crust.
5372,2,5,the euclid alternative,Sheldon,You saw nothing!
5373,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I’m sorry that the demonstration didn’t quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is… don’t. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?"
5374,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon (off),Forget it.
5375,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this."
5376,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon (off),It’s a waste of time. I might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.
5377,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"If you don’t do this, I won’t take you to the comic book store."
5378,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Hello. Nice work with the laser, by the way. Looking out at your fresh young faces, I remember when I too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. Of course, I was 14, and I’d already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to, despite my 9 o’clock bedtime. Now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics, although, it’s more likely that you’ll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava."
5379,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Oh, good God."
5380,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you’ll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard."
5381,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Laser demonstration’s looking pretty good now, huh?"
5382,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Raj,"I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning, there’s a bracing chill in the air."
5383,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Howard,"Plus there’s a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. That’s right, honey, have another calzone, Daddy can wait."
5384,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Raj,Isn’t there a university policy against dating graduate students?
5385,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out."
5386,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Raj,"Damn, there’s always a catch."
5387,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leslie Winkle,"Hey, guys."
5388,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Hey, Leslie."
5389,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leslie,"So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night."
5390,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?
5391,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leslie,Because first-rate minds call you “dumbass”?
5392,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Oh, yeah? Well… you’re a mean person."
5393,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Girl,"Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I’m Ramona Nowitzki, I was at your talk last night. I think you’re just brilliant."
5394,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,That is the prevailing opinion.
5395,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leslie,"Oh, now I’m gonna throw up."
5396,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Howard,"Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Station’s Liquid Waste Disposal System."
5397,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"Ew. Dr. Cooper, I’ve read everything you’ve published. I especially liked your paper on grand unification using string-network condensates and was wondering how you determined that three-dimensional string-nets provided a unified picture of fermions and gauge bosons?"
5398,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle."
5399,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Howard,Woof.
5400,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,The fact is I’m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.
5401,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"Oh, my God, that would change the way we view the entire physical universe."
5402,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,It’s what I do.
5403,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Howard,"You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System is turning a few heads as well."
5404,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"Again, ew. You know, I’d love to hear more about how you intend to add neutrinos. Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?"
5405,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,I don’t drink coffee.
5406,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Howard,I do. I love me a cup of joe.
5407,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"Well, it doesn’t have to be coffee. How about dinner?"
5408,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,I do eat dinner.
5409,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,Great. I know a terrific little Italian place.
5410,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.
5411,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,Excuse me?
5412,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.
5413,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas."
5414,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,What if I brought food to your place?
5415,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace."
5416,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,You got it. I already have your address.
5417,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,What a nice girl.
5418,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Howard,"Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?"
5419,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Yes. Apparently I’m getting a free dinner.
5420,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Oh, yeah, no, this thing’s majorly out of order."
5421,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,See? Sorry.
5422,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,That’s okay. Guess I’m taking the stairs.
5423,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,Where you going?
5424,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,4-A.
5425,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Oh, are you here to see Leonard?"
5426,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"No, Dr. Cooper."
5427,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
5428,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,We’re having dinner.
5429,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?"
5430,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"He is cute, isn’t he?"
5431,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,Sheldon Cooper?
5432,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"Hi, Leonard."
5433,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Hey, Ramona. Come on in."
5434,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,Thanks. Where should I put this?
5435,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Uh, the kitchen’s fine."
5436,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Hey, what are you doing?"
5437,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,I need to see this.
5438,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Uh-huh. The viewing area’s right over there. Sheldon, your girl… date… person… Ramona’s here."
5439,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Oh, hello."
5440,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"Oh, sorry I’m late. I just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper."
5441,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?
5442,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"So funny. But the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity, I have to tell you, I found it physically exhilarating."
5443,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,My hypotheses tend to have that effect.
5444,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,I’m sorry I didn’t bring enough for your friends. I assumed we were going to be alone.
5445,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Oh, yeah. No, we were just going."
5446,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Howard,"To watch, right?"
5447,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"No, come on, now, we’re going out."
5448,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Oh, come on, we’ll be quiet."
5449,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Let’s go. Okay, you two, just, have a nice… whatever this is."
5450,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none of my business, but I just, I have to ask, what’s Sheldon’s deal?"
5451,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,What do you mean “deal”?
5452,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"You know, like what’s his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?"
5453,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Honestly, we’ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal."
5454,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Come on, everybody has a deal."
5455,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Howard,"Not Sheldon. Over the years, we’ve formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. I’m an advocate of mytosis."
5456,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,I’m sorry?
5457,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Howard,I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and split into two Sheldons.
5458,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he’ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton."
5459,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares."
5460,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Hey, do you want to hang out with us?"
5461,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,What are you guys gonna do?
5462,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,Uh…
5463,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Howard,My mom’s making a brisket tonight.
5464,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,The one with the little onions? Mmm.
5465,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Yeah, I’m busy, so, goodnight."
5466,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Howard,Her loss. Let’s go.
5467,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Raj,Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K… To-the-E-to-the-T… Ooh…
5468,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,Don’t.
5469,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Hey, aren’t you having breakfast?"
5470,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Yes.
5471,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
5472,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Not in these pants.
5473,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"So, how’d it go with Ramona last night?"
5474,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Oh, great. She’s smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me."
5475,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,Here’s your spinach mushroom omelette .
5476,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Thank you. Did anyone touch it?
5477,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,Gloves were worn by everyone involved. I was vigilant.
5478,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Ramona pointed out that I’ve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.
5479,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,Time which would be better spent tackling the great physics problems of our day.
5480,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"You don’t tackle the big issues, Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte."
5481,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,Touche.
5482,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leslie,Morning.
5483,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Ah, hey Leslie."
5484,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leslie,"So, Sheldon, I see you’re organizing your papers for the Smithsonian Museum of Dumbassery."
5485,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,There won’t be any room until they get rid of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.
5486,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Oh, good one."
5487,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leslie,I see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you. I’ll let you keep your lunch money today.
5488,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"Okay, Dr. Cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough. If you’re going to stay, you’ll have to be respectful and quiet."
5489,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,Wait for me.
5490,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,So have you worked out the neutrino issue?
5491,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order."
5492,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,You’re so witty.
5493,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Aren’t I?
5494,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Hey, guys, this package came for y…"
5495,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,Dr. Cooper is working.
5496,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Yes, I’m close to a breakthrough. Ooh, it tickles"
5497,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,Sorry.
5498,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,Holy crap on a cracker.
5499,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Hey, Penny."
5500,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Hi. You know, you probably don’t want to go in there."
5501,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,Why? What are they doing?
5502,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist’s office with dolls."
5503,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,Hoo-boy.
5504,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,Dr. Cooper’s working.
5505,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali’s. You coming?"
5506,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, it’s Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies."
5507,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,You’re not going to Halo night.
5508,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Yes, I am. It’s Wednesday. Wednesday’s Halo night.</i>"
5509,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"Didn’t a great man once say, “Science demands nothing less than the fervent and unconditional dedication of our entire lives”?"
5510,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,He did.
5511,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,And who was that great man?
5512,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Me. Sorry, Leonard."
5513,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,Seriously? You’re not coming?
5514,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,You heard her. How can I argue with me?
5515,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good… whatever this is."
5516,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you, your friends are holding you back."
5517,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,I prefer to think of it as I’m pulling them forward.
5518,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,Halo night? A man with your intellectual gifts doesn’t waste an evening playing video games.
5519,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,He does on Wednesdays.
5520,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.
5521,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?
5522,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,What do you think?
5523,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Drat.
5524,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,Now shall we get back to work?
5525,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight.
5526,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,I guess I can wait for the DVD.
5527,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,And then never ever watch it.
5528,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny"
5529,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Sheldon, honey, I’ve told you, it’s a small apartment, you only have to knock one time."
5530,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Please, please, I don’t have a lot of time. Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her."
5531,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,Get rid of her how?
5532,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"I don’t know, but apparently I’m in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them."
5533,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,Excuse me?
5534,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.
5535,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Okay, first of all, it is not man after man."
5536,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,Dr. Cooper?!
5537,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Hide me.
5538,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,Hide you?
5539,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,I formally request sanctuary.
5540,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,Why aren’t you working?
5541,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Um… she distracted me. I told you, Penny, I don’t have time for your nonsense, I have important things to do."
5542,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Oh, man."
5543,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,I know what’s going on here.
5544,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Really? Well, then will you explain it to me?"
5545,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,You’re in love with Dr. Cooper.
5546,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Uh, yeah, no, that’s not it."
5547,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"Don’t try to deny it. He’s a remarkable man, but you have to let him go."
5548,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Oh, gee, okay."
5549,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"I know it’s hard, but he’s a gift to the whole world, and we can’t be selfish."
5550,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Yeah, he’s a gift all right."
5551,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,Sisters?
5552,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Um, sure, sisters."
5553,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,Holy crap on a cracker.
5554,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,Sheldon?
5555,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,What are you doing?!
5556,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,It’s Morse code.
5557,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,Why?
5558,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,So we can communicate through the wall.
5559,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,We are communicating through the wall.
5560,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Yes, but the communication is not encrypted."
5561,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,I don’t know Morse code.
5562,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,It’s very simple. This is A
5563,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,this is B
5564,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,this is C…
5565,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m not going to learn Morse code at three o’clock in the morning!"
5566,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,All right.
5567,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t"
5568,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,Aw! What’s going on?
5569,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Shh! Ramona’s sleeping on the couch.
5570,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,I know. When is she going home?
5571,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Never, that’s the problem. I need your help."
5572,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,What are you talking about?
5573,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,I’m invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement.
5574,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that’s taking over the Earth.
5575,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Come on! Don’t nitpick!
5576,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,Good night.
5577,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Shh. All right, I’m invoking our bodysnatchers clause."
5578,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who’s been replaced with an alien pod.
5579,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Yes. She’s in the living room. Go, I’ll wait here."
5580,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"Sheldon, what are you doing out of bed?"
5581,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Now! Do it!
5582,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,You know you need your sleep in order for your cognitive processing to perform at optimum levels. Now come on.
5583,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Godzilla clause?
5584,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,Not unless she destroys Tokyo.
5585,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Rats.
5586,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,I’ve got it! I finally reconciled the black hole information paradox with my theory of string-network condensates!
5587,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,It’s unbelievable! It’s paradigm-altering!
5588,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,And I could not have done it without you.
5589,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"Oh, please, I just offered a little encouragement."
5590,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"It was a lot more than that. You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions, and you pumiced my hammer toe. How can I ever repay you?"
5591,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"Well, would you consider naming it the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?"
5592,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Who’s Nowitzki?
5593,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,I’m Nowitzki.
5594,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Oh, you want me to share credit?"
5595,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,Uh-huh.
5596,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Get out!
5597,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,"Oh, hey, hi."
5598,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Ramona,"Oh, bite me!"
5599,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Penny,Sisters?
5600,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Girl,"Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I’m Kathy O’Brien. I just finished reading your paper reconciling the black hole information paradox with your theory of string-network condensates, and it just took my breath away."
5601,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Maybe when I publish it, I’ll include an inhaler."
5602,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Kathy,Would you possibly have any time for me to pick your brain?
5603,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Let’s see, today’s Thursday. Thursday nights, I eat pizza from Giacomo’s. Sausage, mushrooms, light olives."
5604,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Kathy,Great. I’ll bring it to your place. I have the address.
5605,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,What a nice girl.
5606,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?"
5607,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"Yes, I’m getting a free pizza. I’m on a roll."
5608,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,"More Pad Thai, please."
5609,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Howard,"Sheldon, you’ve already had four servings."
5610,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Raj,"You might want to slow down a bit, buddy."
5611,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,Just one more bite.
5612,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,"Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?"
5613,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Sheldon,I’m just so… full.
5614,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,That’s it. No more Thai food.
5615,2,6,the cooper-nowitzki theorem,Leonard,Comments are closed.
5616,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"Watch this, it’s really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter."
5617,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard’s phone,"Did you say, call Helen Boxleitner?"
5618,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.
5619,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard’s phone,"Did you say, call Temple Beth Sader."
5620,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,No.
5621,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh."
5622,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,"Oh, that’s very impressive. And a little racist."
5623,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"If we’re all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06"
5624,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,So? We’ll start now.
5625,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break."
5626,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,"We can split it two, two and two."
5627,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Oh, what fresh hell is this?"
5628,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Hey Penny, come on in."
5629,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,Hey guys.
5630,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you’ll have good luck."
5631,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"No you won’t. Uh, can I hide out here for a while."
5632,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,Sure. What’s going on.
5633,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Well, there’s this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christie, well anyway she called me up and she’s like “Hey, how’s California,” and I’m like “Awesome” ‘cos, you know, it’s not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she’s invited herself out here to stay with me."
5634,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,8:08
5635,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Anyway, she got here today, and she’s just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she’s slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink."
5636,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse."
5637,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,He really needs to dial it down.
5638,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"So, if you don’t like this Christie, why are you letting her stay?"
5639,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she’s kind of family."
5640,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"You know, I apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?"
5641,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Oh, I don’t think she’s a whore."
5642,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"No, yeah she’s definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at… where’s Howard?"
5643,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you’re new in town."
5644,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,Oh good grief.
5645,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it’s 8:13 and we’re still not playing Halo."
5646,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Okay, fine, we’ll just play one on one until he gets back."
5647,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"One on one? We don’t play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!"
5648,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
5649,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,"Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there’s a billion more where he came from."
5650,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I’ll play."
5651,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,Great idea.
5652,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that."
5653,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,Why?
5654,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny."
5655,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Oh, what, what, what?"
5656,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story."
5657,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off?"
5658,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,Mine.
5659,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Okay, I got this, lock and load boys."
5660,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,It’s the only way we can play teams.
5661,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Ha-ha, there goes your head again."
5662,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Okay, this isn’t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who’s just respawned, you need to give them a chance to"
5663,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,now come on!
5664,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Raj, Raj, she’s got me cornered, cover me."
5665,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!"
5666,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Penny, you are on fire."
5667,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Yeah, so is Sheldon."
5668,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Okay, that’s it, I don’t know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game."
5669,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something."
5670,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,What?
5671,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,This plasma grenade.
5672,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Ha! Look, it’s raining you!"
5673,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support."
5674,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Gosh, he’s kind of a sore loser, isn’t he?"
5675,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner."
5676,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Well, it’s been fun."
5677,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime."
5678,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,Or we could just have a life.
5679,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,I guess for you that’s an option.
5680,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Good night, Leonard."
5681,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,Good night.
5682,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"As usual, nice talking to you Raj"
5683,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,What do you suppose she meant by that?
5684,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"She’s an enigma, Raj."
5685,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"And another thing, there’s a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab…"
5686,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"She’s gone, Sheldon."
5687,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,Well she could have said goodbye.
5688,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Okay, I have a problem."
5689,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"It’s called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it."
5690,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,What’s wrong?
5691,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Um, well, Howard and Christie are… kind of… hooking up in my bedroom."
5692,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,Are you sure?
5693,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they’re either having sex or Howard’s caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?"
5694,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics."
5695,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Uh, the couch is good."
5696,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment."
5697,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Let me guess, you have a problem with this."
5698,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,Where do I begin?
5699,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"It’s up to you, crazy person’s choice."
5700,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Well first, we don’t have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent I’d ask you to leave."
5701,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else?"
5702,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit."
5703,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,So?
5704,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon."
5705,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"I’m sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?"
5706,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.
5707,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay."
5708,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,Hu.. what?
5709,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"He’s engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It’s the logical fallacy of extending someone’s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and I do not appreciate it."
5710,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,I’ll get you a blanket and a pillow.
5711,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Okay, well since I’m obviously being ignored here, let’s go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly."
5712,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?
5713,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,I suggest no liquids after 11pm.
5714,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,Here you go.
5715,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Hmmph, wrong."
5716,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,I’m listening.
5717,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,Your head goes on the other end.
5718,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,Why?
5719,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"It’s culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders."
5720,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,I’ll risk it.
5721,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,Hm!
5722,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,Anything else I should know.
5723,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,Yes. If you use my toothbrush I’ll jump out that window. Please don’t come to my funeral. Have a good night.
5724,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,Sorry about that.
5725,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,That’s okay.
5726,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light."
5727,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,Got it.
5728,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Well, sleep tight."
5729,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,Thanks.
5730,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally… sleep tight."
5731,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,What are you doing?
5732,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 615, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who."
5733,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,Penny’s still sleeping.
5734,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal…."
5735,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don’t you just have breakfast in bed?"
5736,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother’s Day.
5737,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Uh, what time is it?"
5738,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,Almost 6:30
5739,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,I slept all day?
5740,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Oh, no, it’s 6:30 in the morning."
5741,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,What the hell is your problem?
5742,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste."
5743,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"Ola, nerd-migos."
5744,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?
5745,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"Oh, yeah, sorry, I’ll have it cleaned."
5746,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"That’s okay, keep it. Where’s Christie."
5747,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt, yours reaches places that mine just won’t."
5748,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,Y-you used my loofah?
5749,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out!
5750,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,You can keep that too.
5751,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"Ah, well then we’ll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection."
5752,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie,Howard?
5753,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,In here my lady.
5754,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie,"Mmmm, there’s my little engine that could."
5755,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,Well there’s one beloved children’s book I’ll never read again.
5756,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie,"Hi, Christie."
5757,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,Leonard.
5758,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,I’m Sheldon.
5759,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie,"Right, you’re Howard’s entourage."
5760,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Uh, so Christie, what are your plans?"
5761,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie,"Oh, well, Howard said he’d take me shopping in Beverley Hills."
5762,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don’t love having you, but it’s… a little crowded."
5763,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Penny, you’re always welcome to stay with us."
5764,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Oh, terrific, now we’re running a cute little B&B."
5765,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn’t Christie stay with me."
5766,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,For one thing you live with your mother.
5767,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"I do not, my mother lives with me."
5768,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Well then, it’s all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I’ll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it’s more like Doctor Why Bother."
5769,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,Sheldon you just can’t dictate…
5770,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"No more talking, everybody go."
5771,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Castle Wolowitz?"
5772,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie,"What is that, like a Mexican deli?"
5773,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"I’m sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz."
5774,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie,"Oh, that’s so cool. My first Jew!"
5775,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,I imagine there aren’t many kosher corn-huskers.
5776,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie,"But you’re still taking me shopping, right?"
5777,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,Anything you want.
5778,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie,"Okay, I’ll go pack my stuff."
5779,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,When they perfect human cloning I’m going to order twelve of those.
5780,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Howard, can’t you see she’s using you?"
5781,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!"
5782,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she’ll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things."
5783,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,Really?
5784,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,Yeah.
5785,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"Yay! If you’ll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mizvah bonds to cash."
5786,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz."
5787,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,We can’t order Chinese food without Wolowitz?
5788,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General So’s chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?"
5789,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,I see a problem.
5790,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people.
5791,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"So, we’ll just order three entrees."
5792,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling."
5793,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,We could cut it into thirds.
5794,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich."
5795,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Waiter,"Hi fellas. Oh, where’s your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?"
5796,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,He’s putting his needs ahead of the collective good.
5797,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Where he comes from, that’s punishable by death."
5798,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Waiter,I come from Sacramento.
5799,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four."
5800,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Waiter,No substitutions.
5801,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"This isn’t a substitution, it’s a reduction."
5802,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Waiter,"Okay, no reductions."
5803,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that’s twelve, we’ll each have four."
5804,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,That works.
5805,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"No, if we fill up on dumplings we’ll need to eliminate another entree."
5806,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Waiter,No eliminations.
5807,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"If we have extra, we’ll just take the leftovers home."
5808,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"And divide it how, I’m telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz."
5809,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth."
5810,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls."
5811,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,We don’t order egg rolls.
5812,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Exactly, but we’d have to if she was here."
5813,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,"Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there’s an Indian starving right here."
5814,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Here’s an idea, why don’t we just go out for Indian food."
5815,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,No.
5816,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,Uurgh.
5817,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Waiter,"You are nice boys. Tell you what I’m going to do. I’m going to bring you the four dumplings. When I’m walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know."
5818,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,I’ll know.
5819,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,How about soup?
5820,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Yeah, we can always divide soup."
5821,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,What about the won-tons?
5822,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Oh, hey guys, what’s up?"
5823,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,It’s Halo night.
5824,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,Yeah. Okay. So?
5825,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie,"
5826,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,She’s not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty.
5827,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?"
5828,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don’t think I need to tell you what an honour this is."
5829,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Oh, that’s so sweet. But I’m going out dancing with a girlfriend."
5830,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"You can’t go out, it’s Halo night."
5831,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Well, for Penny it’s dancing night."
5832,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,You go dancing every Wednesday.
5833,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,No.
5834,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,Then it’s not dancing night.
5835,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Look, why don’t I play with you guys tomorrow?"
5836,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Tonight is Halo night, it’s like talking to a wall."
5837,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem."
5838,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Sheldon, remember, we role-played this."
5839,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Yes, but you didn’t portray her as completely irrational."
5840,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck."
5841,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.
5842,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can’t, there are three of us and two of them."
5843,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,So?
5844,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"It’s the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child’s play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman."
5845,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Aaah, for God’s sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy."
5846,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"Your anger’s not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics."
5847,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"No, I’m pretty sure my anger’s with you."
5848,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,What’s happening to us? We’re falling apart.
5849,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,Who are you calling?
5850,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
5851,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.
5852,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie,And this is Christie Van Der Bell.
5853,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,We can’t get to the phone right now because we’re having sex.
5854,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie,You’re not going to put that on your message are you?
5855,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Sheldon, think this through, you’re going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo."
5856,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"No, I’m going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems."
5857,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"You’re right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact."
5858,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,My point.
5859,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie,"I’m just saying, you can take the damned plastic off the couch once in a while."
5860,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard’s Mother,"Why, so you and Howard can hump on it?"
5861,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"Ladies, ladies, I’m sure there’s a middle ground."
5862,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie and Howard’s Mother together,Shut up Howard.
5863,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"You girl’s talk, I’m going to take my scooter out for a little spin."
5864,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie,"Are you happy, you drove your own son out of the house."
5865,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard’s Mother,Why don’t you stop butting in where you don’t belong.
5866,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,What are you guys doing here?
5867,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,It’s Halo night.
5868,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard’s Mother,"He’s not a man, he’s a putz, and don’t you take that tone with me, you gold digger."
5869,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie,What did you call me?
5870,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard’s Mother,"You heard me, and I’ll tell you something else, you’re barking up the wrong tree, cos as long as you’re around, Howard is out of the will."
5871,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Christie,"You know what, I got better offers, I’m out of here."
5872,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard’s Mother,"That’s right, go back to Babylon, you whore."
5873,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"So, Halo night, huh?"
5874,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,I thought she was the whore of Omaha?
5875,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,Shhh!
5876,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he’s charging his plasma rifle."
5877,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"I can’t shoot now, I’m cloaking."
5878,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"Now, Raj, kill Sheldon."
5879,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,I can’t see him.
5880,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,"That’s why the call it cloaking, dead man."
5881,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,Well then start throwing grenades.
5882,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,I’m all out.
5883,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Penny,"Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you."
5884,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"That will do, Raj, straight for the tank."
5885,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,We said no tanks.
5886,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,There are no rules in hell!
5887,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Howard,"Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack!"
5888,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"There’s a sniper, use your rocket launcher."
5889,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,"All I’ve got is a needler, and I’m all out of ammo."
5890,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Sheldon,And now you’re out of life. Why did you hit pause?
5891,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,I thought I heard something.
5892,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Raj,What?
5893,2,7,the panty pinata polarization,Leonard,"No, never mind, alright, go."
5894,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"Oh look, Saturn 3 is on."
5895,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,I don’t want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.
5896,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?
5897,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,Simple subtraction will tell you it’s six better.
5898,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.
5899,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,In what sense is that a compromise?
5900,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Well, five is partway between three… Never mind."
5901,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,"I’ll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?"
5902,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"Ooh, I don’t think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock."
5903,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,What?
5904,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"It’s very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
5905,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,"Okay, I think I got it."
5906,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Together,Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock!
5907,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Hello, boys."
5908,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Ahoy, matey."
5909,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Noticed the eye patch, did you? It’s all part of a technique I’ve been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable."
5910,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters."
5911,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye."
5912,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs."
5913,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,What are negs?
5914,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like “Normally, I’m not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.” I’ve got a whole list of ’em. Who wants to be my wingman?"
5915,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"You’re not gonna need wingman, you’re gonna need a paramedic."
5916,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,"Howard, your scooter’s blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?"
5917,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair?"
5918,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,"Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster."
5919,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,Ow.
5920,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, but I’m not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I’ve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended."
5921,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Well, I want to watch it now."
5922,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Then I believe we’ve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.
5923,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,Watch whatever you want.
5924,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,I saw what you did there.
5925,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,What did I do?
5926,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Hello. Hey, Howard. What’s wrong? Okay. Okay, we’ll be right there."
5927,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,What happened?
5928,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,Howard’s at the Mars Rover lab. He says he’s in trouble. Defcon 5.
5929,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"Defcon 5? Well, there’s no need to rush."
5930,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,What?
5931,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Defcon 5 means no danger. Defcon 1 is a crisis.
5932,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,How can 5 not be worse than 1?
5933,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,"Yeah, Star Trek V, worse than I."
5934,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"Okay, first of all, that’s a comparison of quality, not intensity. Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V."
5935,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.
5936,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"No, no, no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction, while Star Trek I fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing."
5937,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?
5938,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,Star Trek V!
5939,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"All right, will you at least stipulate that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is inarguably the best?"
5940,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.
5941,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Oh, thank God, you’re here."
5942,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,What’s the emergency?
5943,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.
5944,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Where?
5945,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!
5946,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Woman,"Howard, is everything okay?"
5947,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Yeah, baby, I’ll be right in."
5948,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?
5949,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She’s a doctor. One free barium enema and my mother won’t care she’s not Jewish."
5950,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?"
5951,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"No, there were three other guys with eye patches, iIt was a fiasco. What did work was, “How’d you like to visit a secret government facility?”"
5952,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,So what exactly do you want us to do?
5953,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she’s here. She doesn’t exactly have clearance."
5954,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Really? They don’t let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?
5955,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Yes, I was bad. Maybe she’ll spank me. Can we please move on?"
5956,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Girl,"Hey, Howard, you know, it’s getting late, so do I get to drive this thing or what?"
5957,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Yeah. No. I’m sorry, but something’s come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home."
5958,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Girl,"Oh, okay. Let’s go, friend Leonard."
5959,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,Okay.
5960,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,I’ll call ya.
5961,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Girl,Yeah. So are you a scientist like Howard?
5962,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,No one’s a scientist like Howard.
5963,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,My mother is so gonna love her.
5964,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison."
5965,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Girl,"I’m sorry. I totally interrupted you. What, what, what were you saying?"
5966,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Just said Howard’s a terrific guy. He’s got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much."
5967,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Girl,I really like that you’re such a loyal friend.
5968,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?"
5969,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Girl,Are you insane? The guy was wearing an eye patch.
5970,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,Then why did you?
5971,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Girl,He said that I could drive a car on Mars.
5972,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Got it. So, can I see you again?"
5973,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Girl,You’re not gonna see me now.
5974,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,Ooh. Cool.
5975,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,Anything?
5976,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,"Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding."
5977,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.
5978,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Hang on, there’s got to be other options."
5979,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,"You could try calling Triple-A, but based on NASA’s latest timetable, they won’t get there for 35 years."
5980,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.
5981,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,"Oh, snap."
5982,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Snap what?
5983,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B."
5984,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,What’s Plan B?
5985,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run."
5986,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Why wasn’t that Plan A?
5987,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Voice from television,"REPORTER:  A NASA spokesman states that due to the loss of data, they will most likely be unable to determine the cause of the Mars Rover’s malfunction. This is not the first time an exploratory mission to Mars has ended in disappointment."
5988,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,Thank God for Plan B.
5989,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,"Howard, didn’t you say you worked on the Mars Rover?"
5990,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"No, you’re mistaken."
5991,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,"Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars."
5992,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,I don’t know what you’re talking about.
5993,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,Psst! Psst!
5994,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he’d like to talk to me in private.
5995,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,"No. Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world."
5996,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Well, that does sound like me, but no."
5997,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Is there some problem?
5998,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while."
5999,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"All right, goodbye."
6000,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don’t know."
6001,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Where are you going?
6002,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,I can’t tell you that.
6003,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Who would ask me?
6004,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"I can’t tell you that, either."
6005,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,So you brought me in here to inform me that you can’t tell me where you’re going and you can’t tell me who might ask?
6006,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Yeah, I really didn’t think this through."
6007,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"Leonard, a moment."
6008,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,What?
6009,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"If someone, and of course, we don’t know who this would be, does ask where you’ve gone, what should I say?"
6010,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,I don’t know. Just tell them I went to the office.
6011,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Are you going to the office?
6012,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,No.
6013,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Then how can I say it convincingly?
6014,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Just say, Leonard went to the office."
6015,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,All right.
6016,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office."
6017,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,This would have worked out a lot better if you’d just told me you were going the office.
6018,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,I’m going to the office.
6019,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,See? Why don’t I believe you?
6020,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,I’m going out for a while.
6021,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,Okay.
6022,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Doesn’t anyone want to know where he’s going?
6023,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,"Okay, where is he going?"
6024,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Leonard is going to the office
6025,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,So how was work today?
6026,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Girl,"Busy. I removed an appendix, a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel."
6027,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,I’m hoping that’s three different guys.
6028,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Girl,"No, just the one. He didn’t make it. So, how was your day?"
6029,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Oh, you know, I’m a physicist, so, I thought about stuff."
6030,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Girl,That’s it?
6031,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Well, I wrote some of it down."
6032,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Girl,Are you done eating?
6033,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Uh, yeah."
6034,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Girl,"Oh, good."
6035,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"If I knew you were waiting, I would’ve swallowed that lasagna whole."
6036,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
6037,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Hey, Steph, it’s me again, Howard. Listen, if you’re free Friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. My mom cooks a hell of a brisket. Let me know. It’s Howard."
6038,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,I’ve had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.
6039,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Steph,Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom.
6040,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"That’s a good idea. There’s a bed in there, and I’m very, very, very pro-bed."
6041,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
6042,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Hey, it’s me again. Just want to let you know the head count for dinner Friday has gone up. My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs. Oh, and if anybody should ask, you’re half-Jewish on your mother’s side. Okay, call me. It’s Howard."
6043,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,Don’t you think we should tell him you’re not interested?
6044,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Steph,Do you want me to stop and call him back right now?
6045,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Dear God, no!"
6046,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Steph,"Oh, Leonard…"
6047,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Steph,You’ve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.
6048,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Hey, it’s me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we’re gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant."
6049,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard’s Mother,Tell her we’re going to the Olive Garden! I have a coupon from the paper.
6050,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"We’re not going to the Olive Garden, Mom!"
6051,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard’s Mother,"Oh, Mr. Bigshot with his Red Lobster."
6052,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,I’ll call you back when we firm up the details. It’s Howard.
6053,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,"Oh, hey."
6054,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,Hey.
6055,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,New shirts?
6056,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Yeah, a couple."
6057,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,Nice.
6058,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,Thank you.
6059,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,"So, who’s the girl?"
6060,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,I’m sorry?
6061,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,"Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating."
6062,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?"
6063,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,"Well, yeah, we did have a date."
6064,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him."
6065,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,"So, who is she?"
6066,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Oh, she’s a doctor."
6067,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,"Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?"
6068,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he’s dating someone, but he’s not because, in fact, you’re dating her, does that make you a bad person?"
6069,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,"Well, that depends."
6070,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,On what?
6071,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,Is that friend Wolowitz?
6072,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,Yeah.
6073,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,Screw him. You’re fine.
6074,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,Are you sure?
6075,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,"Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you."
6076,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,Does that change things?
6077,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,No.
6078,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,So why’d you ask?
6079,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Penny,I’m nosy. See ya.
6080,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard’s Mother,"Howard, get the door!"
6081,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,Really? Is that what you do when someone knocks? Thank you. I had no idea!
6082,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell?"
6083,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard’s Mother,Who is it?!
6084,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,It’s Leonard!
6085,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard’s Mother,You’re gonna have to play outside! I’m not dressed to receive!
6086,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"No one cares, Ma! So, what’s up?"
6087,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Listen, I need to talk to you about something."
6088,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Momentito. Yello. Oh, Stephanie, thanks for calling me back. I was worried… Oh… Uh-huh… Uh-huh… Uh-huh… No, I understand… Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely. Thanks for calling. Yeah, you have a nice day, too."
6089,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,You are dead to me.
6090,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,"Okay, who gets the extra dumpling?"
6091,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,All,Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.
6092,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock."
6093,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,How do we decide that?
6094,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,All,Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. Oh!
6095,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Oh, hey, guys."
6096,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,Hello.
6097,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,Hey.
6098,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Hi, Howard. Howard?"
6099,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,Sheldon.
6100,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence."
6101,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,That’s just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?
6102,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"I don’t make the rules, Leonard."
6103,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Howard, come on, I didn’t plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen."
6104,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,Did someone just feel a cold breeze?
6105,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.
6106,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Raj,"You know, screw it, I’m just gonna eat the dumpling."
6107,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Oh, hi, Steph, come on in."
6108,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Steph,Is this a bad time?
6109,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Yeah, but I don’t see a better one on the horizon, so…"
6110,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Oh, if it isn’t Mrs. Dead to Me."
6111,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Steph,"Hello, Howard."
6112,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,Sheldon?
6113,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Sheldon,"Look I’m sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I’m out."
6114,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,He just won’t listen to me.
6115,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Steph,"Okay, I guess it’ll just be the three of us then."
6116,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,Hmm. Lisa’s gonna be disappointed.
6117,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Steph,Yeah.
6118,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,Lisa?
6119,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Steph,"Yeah, my roommate. She just went through a really bad breakup and I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you."
6120,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Leonard, Stephanie, you’re alive, it’s a miracle!"
6121,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I’m sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday. My mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get."
6122,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Leonard,"Howard, Howard, look at this."
6123,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,"Anyway, call me. It’s Howard."
6124,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Voice from TV,"The possibility of life on Mars has long fascinated scientists and laypersons alike. It’s unclear how the Mars Rover got into the crevice, but one thing’s certain, the data which it has sent back contain the first clear indications that there may have been life on Mars. It’s a scientific discovery that has staggering implications for all mankind. Unfortunately, we’ll never know who’s responsible."
6125,2,8,the lizard spock expansion,Howard,Son of a bitch.
6126,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Penny, hello."
6127,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
6128,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,What is shaking?
6129,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,I’m sorry?
6130,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"It’s colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?"
6131,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,What’s wrong with you? you’re freaking me out.
6132,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,I’m striking up a casual conversation with you. S’u’up?
6133,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,Please don’t do that.
6134,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"All right, But I’m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it’s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat."
6135,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"So, this wasn’t the awkward part?"
6136,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,No.
6137,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Oh, all right. S’u’up?"
6138,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you’re aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?"
6139,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Okay, feeling the awkward now."
6140,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.
6141,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Yeah, Leonard told me."
6142,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.
6143,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,To you?
6144,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard’s been involved with, she’s the only one I have ever found tolerable."
6145,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Well, what about me?"
6146,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,The statement stands for itself.
6147,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Well, aren’t you sweet?"
6148,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival."
6149,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Yeah, I think she’s pretty safe."
6150,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you’re sitting in your apartment, it’s late, you’re alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth."
6151,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,Really?
6152,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido."
6153,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,I could think about you.
6154,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Fine, whatever works."
6155,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Always nice talking to you, Sheldon."
6156,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Uh, peace out!"
6157,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Well, this is very pleasant."
6158,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.
6159,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,And you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us.
6160,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,I stand corrected.
6161,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked."
6162,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,That’s very interesting.
6163,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,Thank you.
6164,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,She doesn’t mean it. She’s just being nice.
6165,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I’ll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?"
6166,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,No.
6167,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,Good. What’s your favourite fruit?
6168,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"Ih-uh, strawberries."
6169,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?"
6170,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"Uh, Lawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas."
6171,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,Really? That’s where I was born!
6172,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,You’re kidding!
6173,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter."
6174,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"Why, what-what-what happened?"
6175,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.
6176,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"I’m sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?"
6177,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"No, I didn’t try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner."
6178,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"Uh, Sheldon?"
6179,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?"
6180,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Look at that, there’s even pasta left over."
6181,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
6182,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"I do. Do you? Because frankly, you’ve been in a foul mood since I sat down."
6183,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"Okay, here’s my question, why did you sit down?"
6184,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed."
6185,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,What landing party?
6186,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"You’re Kirk, I’m Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we’ve got McCoy."
6187,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"So, we’re all standing around looking at the post-op x ray and there it is, clear as day, right in the guy’s chest cavity, one of my earrings."
6188,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"Oh, my god, what did you do?"
6189,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!"
6190,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"I have a bone to pick with you, sir."
6191,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,Oo-oo-oh!
6192,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"Hi, Sheldon."
6193,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Hi, Stephanie. I’m sorry I’m late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation."
6194,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,What invitation?
6195,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"We’re going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn’t have done a better job."
6196,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"Oh, clearly I could have."
6197,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I’ll find us seats."
6198,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"No, no, we have seats."
6199,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,Not the right seats.
6200,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,What is he doing?
6201,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,He’s finding the acoustic sweet spot.
6202,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,Does he always do this?
6203,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.
6204,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"No, it’s fine. you know, he’s sweet."
6205,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"My apologies, you’ve been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one?"
6206,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"No, just sit here."
6207,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Oh, yeah, this is it."
6208,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Leonard, Leonard, Leonard"
6209,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?"
6210,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,Tell me what you see here.
6211,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
6212,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"This is Stephanie’s facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?"
6213,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,Stephanie Barnett is single.
6214,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who’s Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?"
6215,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,It’s just her facebook page and we’ve only been going out a couple of weeks.
6216,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"You don’t see it, do you? We’re losing her."
6217,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"Okay, I’m going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie."
6218,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"I’m afraid I can’t allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command."
6219,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation."
6220,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,Give me one good reason why not.
6221,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,Because this is not Star Trek
6222,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny."
6223,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,What?
6224,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,This is banana bread.
6225,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,This is a door knob.
6226,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,It’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.
6227,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Sheldon, would you like to come in?"
6228,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?
6229,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,No.
6230,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,How can you be sure?
6231,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Sheldon, what do you want?"
6232,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"I’m certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship."
6233,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,He’s having problems with Stephanie?
6234,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"She’s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks."
6235,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,What?
6236,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I’m gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don’t worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom."
6237,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,We never got to the bedroom.
6238,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,Because?
6239,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I’ll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house."
6240,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"It’s not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?"
6241,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships."
6242,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Raj,You told me you were going to have the talk with him.
6243,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Howard,I’ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.
6244,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"More to the point, it’s about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together."
6245,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Howard,"Oh, I don’t think you can."
6246,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Well, why not?"
6247,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Howard,Look at Leonard’s record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.
6248,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Raj,During which she defected to North Korea.
6249,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Howard,Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.
6250,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Raj,For which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light Leonard.”
6251,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Howard,And a three hour dinner with Penny.
6252,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Raj,Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.
6253,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Howard,"Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes."
6254,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Yes, I’m aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?"
6255,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Raj,"Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet."
6256,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Howard,"I’ll tell you what you shouldn’t do. Don’t spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn’t work at all, no matter how much you put on."
6257,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"So, that’s all you’ve got? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?"
6258,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Howard,Yes.
6259,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Raj,Yeah.
6260,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny."
6261,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,What?
6262,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,Penny. Zucchini bread.
6263,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Oh, thank you."
6264,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,May I come in?
6265,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,No.
6266,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.
6267,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Well, thank you."
6268,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?"
6269,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,Yes.
6270,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?
6271,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,What?
6272,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"I’ve been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in"
6273,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Clearly, I’m 14 days too early."
6274,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"All I’m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can’t they do something about lactose intolerance?"
6275,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"Leonard, you’re going to have to let this go. You had a little cheese dip, you farted, I thought it was cute."
6276,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Oh, hi Stephanie."
6277,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,Hi.
6278,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,Want some more wine?
6279,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"Yeah, I assume I’m not driving anywhere tonight."
6280,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,What are you doing?
6281,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.
6282,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
6283,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,I’m helping you with Stephanie.
6284,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,By making constipated moose sounds?
6285,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love."
6286,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?
6287,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Yes, actually it would, but let’s see how the lid goes. I’m not strong enough, Leonard, you’ll have to do it."
6288,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"Oh, for god’s sakes."
6289,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Go ahead, it’s pre-loosened."
6290,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,Do you want some help with that?
6291,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"No, no, no, I got it."
6292,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"No, yeah, yeah, he’s got it, and that’s not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it."
6293,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"Oh my god, are you okay?"
6294,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"No, I’m not. I’m bleeding."
6295,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,Like a gladiator!
6296,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"Oh, honey, you’re going to need stitches."
6297,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,Stitches? With a needle?
6298,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"Well, yeah, I mean, just a few."
6299,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec."
6300,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there."
6301,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can’t argue with her results. It’s a shame it won’t scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity."
6302,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,I can’t remember a time when you weren’t talking.
6303,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears."
6304,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery."
6305,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,Watery?
6306,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,She stuck a needle into my hand!
6307,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"Hey, how’s my big cry baby?"
6308,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,I didn’t cry.
6309,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"Okay, I’m just teasing you. But, yeah, you did. Alright, it’s all good. what do you say we get you home and put you to bed?"
6310,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"Oh, are you still going to spend the night?"
6311,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest."
6312,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"She’s right, as long as you’re vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated."
6313,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"Thank you, Dr. Cooper."
6314,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"You’re welcome, Dr. Hofstadter."
6315,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Steph,"Okay, I’m going to go get your discharge papers."
6316,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,What?
6317,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I just can’t understand why women have such a hard time loving you."
6318,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"Hey, can you open this for me?"
6319,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Raj,Can I see your stitches?
6320,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,Sure.
6321,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Raj,Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.
6322,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Leonard, congratulations."
6323,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,What for?
6324,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,Your facebook status update. Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship.
6325,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"What? no. no, that’s not right."
6326,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Howard,"Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy."
6327,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? That’s bold."
6328,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"It’s not bold, it’s a mistake. I didn’t change my status."
6329,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Well, then who did?"
6330,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"I had no choice, he cried in front of her."
6331,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,You hacked my facebook account?
6332,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"Oh, it’s hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, Kal-el."
6333,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,Are you insane? Now she’s going to think I’m desperate. You’ve destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don’t even understand what you did wrong because you can’t conceive of something that you are not an expert in!
6334,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,In which I am not an expert.
6335,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,Don’t even! I don’t want to hear another word out of you.
6336,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"What’s wrong, Lassie? Timmy fall down the well?"
6337,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Penny,"Oh, wow. She just updated her facebook status."
6338,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Howard,Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship with Leonard Hofstadter.”
6339,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Leonard,"Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend."
6340,2,9,the white asparagus triangulation,Sheldon,"If I am permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win."
6341,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"I don’t see anything at all, Sheldon."
6342,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,"Well, you’re the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound."
6343,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Me, too."
6344,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,Is it a high-frequency whistle?
6345,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"No, it’s more of a relentless, narcissistic drone."
6346,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"Yup, there’s no inflammation at all, Sheldon."
6347,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,Then it must be a tumour.
6348,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,I Seriously doubt it.
6349,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Maybe it’s a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
6350,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.
6351,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"Well, you know, if it is from a swirly, there’s something I can do. Okay, circle, circle, dot, dot, now you have a cootie shot! I’m going to bed"
6352,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Okay, I’ll be right in."
6353,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,"It’s not enough that she mocks me, but that isn’t even the correct procedure for a cootie shot."
6354,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Do you understand that Stephanie’s not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
6355,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C? Is that imaginary? I don’t think so.
6356,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Good night.
6357,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,"Leonard, there’s one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, I’m calling an emergency meeting."
6358,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"No, you’re not."
6359,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,"Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I’d like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie."
6360,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Thank you.
6361,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,"That being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon “cohabitation” rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together."
6362,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,We’re not living together.
6363,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,"I beg to disagree. “A girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with un-quote Leonard when she has stayed over for A, ten consecutive nights or B, more than nine nights in three week period or C: all the weekends of a given month plus three weeknights."
6364,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,That’s absurd.
6365,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,"You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H."
6366,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers."
6367,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,"Hmm, yes, you did. Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I’m given to understand women have different needs, so, we’ll have to discuss that."
6368,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,I’m going to bed.
6369,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,"At least take this with you. Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve."
6370,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"No, absolutely not."
6371,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,It’s not a big deal. We have latex gloves.
6372,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"I don’t care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam."
6373,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"Hi, Sheldon."
6374,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,"Good morning, Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night."
6375,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Oh come on! Sheldon, we don’t ask questions like that."
6376,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?
6377,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,He did very nicely.
6378,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,See? She’s not offended. And now you finally have an answer.
6379,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Out of coffee. Need coffee.
6380,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"Uh, hello."
6381,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Hi! Stephanie, right?"
6382,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"Uh-huh. And, and, and you are?"
6383,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"I’m Penny, I live across the hall. I’ve heard a lot about you."
6384,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,Really?
6385,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Mm-hmm.
6386,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,I haven’t heard a thing about you. Leonard? Why haven’t I heard a thing about this woman who lives across the hall and comes into your apartment in the morning in her underwear?
6387,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"She’s heard about you because we’re, you know, involved and you haven’t heard about her because… I never slept with her, I swear!"
6388,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,"In Leonard’s defence, it wasn’t for lack of trying."
6389,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Thank you, Sheldon."
6390,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,"You’re welcome, Leonard."
6391,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Look, I’m just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it’s very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I’ll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian."
6392,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,Really? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
6393,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"She doesn’t like you. Um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so…"
6394,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"Well, it was very nice meeting you."
6395,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Nice to finally meet you, too."
6396,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,And I’ll see you tonight?
6397,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Okay, bye-bye."
6398,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,Bye.
6399,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?
6400,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"So, that’s Stephanie, huh?"
6401,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Why do I feel like I’m the one that just got the prostate exam?
6402,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"You know, she seems very nice."
6403,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,"Oh, she is. She’s terrific, and she’s proving to be a valuable roommate."
6404,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Roommate? You guys are living together?
6405,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,Like hippies.
6406,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,We’re not living together.
6407,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?
6408,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,We’re not living together.
6409,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Are you sure?
6410,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,How could I not be sure?
6411,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Well, let’s find out."
6412,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Don’t you think if a woman was living with me I’d be the first one to know about it?
6413,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Oh, sweetie, you’d be the last one to know about it."
6414,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Hmm, cute dresses. I bet this looks great on you!"
6415,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,We’re not living together.
6416,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?"
6417,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,We’re not living together.
6418,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Okay, moving on. Now, who are these guys at Disney World?"
6419,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Uh, the big dog is Goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea. We’re not living together!"
6420,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"You’re going to go down swinging, huh? All right, well, we got your body lotion, your InStyle Magazine, your jewellery box."
6421,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,We’re not… Where’s my Bat Signal?
6422,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,You have a Bat Signal?
6423,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"I did. It was right here. She must’ve… Oh, my God, we’re living together."
6424,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Really? What was your first clue?
6425,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Howard,New pants?
6426,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Yeah, Stephanie got them for me."
6427,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Howard,Nice. Cotton?
6428,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Actually, I think it’s more of wool, fire ant blend."
6429,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Howard,"So, the girlfriend’s buying clothes for you, huh? Sounds serious."
6430,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"It is actually. In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together."
6431,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Howard,"Uh, Leonard, huge mistake. There’s a whole buffet of women out there and you’re just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again."
6432,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,At least I have an egg. What do you have?
6433,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Howard,A veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners. See the blonde over there? I can hit on her and you can’t.
6434,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"So, go hit on her."
6435,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Howard,She’s not my type.
6436,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Raj,"Too bad, ’cause she was checking you out before."
6437,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Howard,She was?
6438,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Raj,Of course not. Look at her.
6439,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"I don’t care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me."
6440,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
6441,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.
6442,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?
6443,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,"My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer."
6444,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,Thank you.
6445,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,Didn’t they teach you that in medical school?
6446,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"I’m kinda busy here, Sheldon."
6447,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.
6448,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"A cardiac stress test, a full body MRI, an electromyogram, a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?"
6449,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,"Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions."
6450,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"Go home, Sheldon."
6451,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!
6452,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Oh hey.
6453,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?"
6454,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Yeah, sure. What are you washing? A crocodile?"
6455,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"No, the pants that Stephanie got me."
6456,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Oh, sweetie, you can’t machine wash these. They’ll be ruined."
6457,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Are you sure?
6458,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Absolutely.
6459,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Oh, no. I wish you’d told me that sooner."
6460,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Are you guys having problems?
6461,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"No, everything’s fine."
6462,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Really?
6463,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Yeah. It’s wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it’s fine, it’s great."
6464,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Okay, Leonard, honey, you know, if you’re uncomfortable with the way things are going, you’re allowed to say something."
6465,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.
6466,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers."
6467,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,No that doesn’t sound right either.
6468,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.
6469,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Yeah, I could say something like that to her. I’ll go do that. Thank you."
6470,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Sure.
6471,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?
6472,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"You’re kidding, right?"
6473,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"No, but that’s okay. I’ll go talk to her. Want to come with?"
6474,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Go! Wow.
6475,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"Oh, no."
6476,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,Wha??
6477,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed. I mean, I’ve never seen anything like it."
6478,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,I knew it! What do I do?
6479,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,You’re going to need to stop talking immediately.
6480,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Sheldon,For how…
6481,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,Du-du-du-du! Immediately.
6482,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Hey.
6483,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"Oh, hi, honey."
6484,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Sheldon.
6485,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,What’s going on?
6486,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,I just performed a Sheldonectomy.
6487,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Careful, if you don’t get it all, it’ll only come back worse."
6488,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,Gotcha.
6489,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Listen, we need to talk."
6490,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,Oh-oh. Do we need to talk or do we “need to talk”?
6491,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,I don’t know what that means.
6492,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"Okay, why don’t you just tell me what it is you have to tell me?"
6493,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Okay, um, well, look, it’s just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick."
6494,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,And?
6495,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,It’s just a little scary.
6496,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"Well, yeah, but scary good, right?"
6497,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Sure, when is scary not good? But, okay, um, I have feelings, right?"
6498,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,Uh-huh.
6499,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Okay, and it’s perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?"
6500,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,Of course honey why don’t you tell me what it is you’re feeling?
6501,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Okay, well, I ju… I think it’s important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and… oh, shoot, I had it!"
6502,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"Okay, how about this? How about I tell you what I’m feeling?"
6503,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,What’s that? Really? Right now?
6504,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,Why not?
6505,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"I just ate, aren’t you supposed to wait an hour?"
6506,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,I think that’s for swimming.
6507,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Oh, okay. I just hope I don’t get cramps."
6508,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,Yeah.
6509,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Hey.
6510,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Hey. Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer."
6511,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Thank you.
6512,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Your pants are ruined.
6513,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Good.
6514,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?"
6515,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Well, um, on one level, really, really well."
6516,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?"
6517,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings."
6518,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Good, good. And then what?"
6519,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"And then the, the subject got changed somehow."
6520,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"You had sex, didn’t you?"
6521,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Um, little bit."
6522,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,What?
6523,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Nothing. Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out."
6524,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Yeah, yeah it’s all good. Everything’s going to work out. One way or another."
6525,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Come on, Leonard, you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to."
6526,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Really?
6527,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Yes, you don’t always have to go along with what the woman wants."
6528,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Huh.
6529,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,What?
6530,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, here’s the thing, I’m afraid that if I ask her to move out, she’ll just dump me."
6531,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Well, it’s a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if it’s meant to be, it’ll be."
6532,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?"
6533,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"I don’t know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?"
6534,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?"
6535,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Yeah, that’ll slow it down."
6536,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"I’m sorry, I totally interrupted you. What were you saying?"
6537,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Oh, right, yeah, um, so, Stephanie, here’s the thing. I really like you."
6538,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"Oh, God, here comes the speech."
6539,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,What speech?
6540,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"I really like you, but maybe we should spend a little less time together ‘cause I need my space but I’ll call you on Tuesday, and then you never call me so I call you, but you don’t call me back and then when I run into you at the coffee shop you pretend like you’ve been having problems with your voice mail and I know that you’re lying, but I pretend like I don’t care even though I’m dying inside!"
6541,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"No! No, no! I wasn’t going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you."
6542,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Steph,"Oh. Oh, good! ‘Cause I really like you, too."
6543,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Terrific.
6544,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Hey.
6545,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Raj,Hey.
6546,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Howard,Hey. Nice sweater.
6547,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It’s kind of fun."
6548,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Raj,"It’s got a big bird on it, dude."
6549,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, that’s the fun part. We’re also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I don’t even know what a duvet is but I’m pretty sure if I did I wouldn’t want one, but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex."
6550,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Raj,"You’re lucky. With me, it’s usually the other way around."
6551,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Howard,"You know, if you can’t talk to her, why don’t you just text her?"
6552,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Isn’t that kind of cowardly?
6553,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Howard,"Oh, yeah. It’s beyond contemptible."
6554,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Raj,"It’s true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater."
6555,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,Sold. “I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.” There. It’s done.
6556,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Howard,Good for you.
6557,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,"Yeah, good for me. I’ll never have sex again."
6558,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Leonard,I was wrong. See ya.
6559,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Sheldon?
6560,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Computer voice,I have an inflamed larynx.
6561,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Okay?
6562,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Computer voice,We’re out of herbal tea. Do you have any?
6563,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,"Okay, let me check."
6564,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Computer voice,"Some hiney would be nice, too."
6565,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Penny,Hiney?
6566,2,10,the vartabedian conundrum,Computer voice,Honey.
6567,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. It is well established Superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earth’s yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh."
6568,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?
6569,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,Like what?
6570,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,I don’t know. Kryptonian mustard.
6571,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.
6572,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Raj,"Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite, the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth."
6573,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Raj, please, let’s stay serious here. Superman’s body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian."
6574,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,"Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?"
6575,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,Superman doesn’t sweat on Earth.
6576,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,"Okay, he’s invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor. He miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. Now, before dinner, his host says, “who’s up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?” Superman says “sure,” works up a sweat, comes back to Earth, his uniform now stained with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration."
6577,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Raj,Booya.
6578,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.
6579,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Raj,"“Kandorian dry cl…” I give up, you can’t have a rational argument with this man."
6580,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,"Hey, isn’t that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year? No, not all at once."
6581,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Raj,Then how?
6582,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,"Leonard. Now, Raj. Now, Sheldon."
6583,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Raj,I didn’t get a good look. Can I go again?
6584,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,No.
6585,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,It’s David Underhill. So what?
6586,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.
6587,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"I have two words for you. The first is big, the other’s whoop."
6588,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work you’ve done since you’ve been here completely useless.
6589,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,Did not.
6590,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,"Did, too."
6591,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Did… okay, maybe  some of it, but, look, the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky."
6592,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Raj,In more ways than one. He’s a very handsome man.
6593,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,"Doesn’t do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way, I’m more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy."
6594,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Raj,"Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron."
6595,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,"Excuse me, Are you Leonard Hofstadter?"
6596,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Uh, yeah."
6597,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,I’m David Underhill.
6598,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Uh, y-yeah."
6599,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,"Yeah, Dr. Gablehauser said if I wanted to set something up in the photomultiplier lab, that you’d be able to give me a hand?"
6600,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,You want to work with me?
6601,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,"Well, if you have a little time, yeah."
6602,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Wow, y-yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem. Uh, Here’s my home number, here’s my cell, here’s my office, here’s my parents’ number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me. So…"
6603,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,Okay.
6604,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan."
6605,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,Thanks. I’ll call you.
6606,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?You’ve never seen a hypocrite before?
6607,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Raj,"Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper, who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68."
6608,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Hey, guys!"
6609,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,That doesn’t count. Do over! Do over!
6610,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.
6611,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,There are always do-overs when my people play sports.
6612,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,Where were you that’s more important than Wii bowling night?
6613,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Actually, I was…"
6614,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,It’s a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.
6615,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Come on, it’s just a video game. And we suck at it."
6616,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,Nice motivational speech from the team captain.
6617,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,Where were you?
6618,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,I was working with Dave Underhill.
6619,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,"Ooh, “Dave.” Sounds like Leonard’s got a new BFF."
6620,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Actually, he’s pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he’s a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band."
6621,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,So? We’re in a rock band.
6622,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"No, we play Rock Band on our X-Box."
6623,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.
6624,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"He’s funny, too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? That’s not, he does it better. Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so I’m gonna go practice my situps."
6625,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Raj,"Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude."
6626,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,Yep. It’s officially a bro-mance.
6627,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard putting up a Christmas tree?"
6628,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"No, because we don’t celebrate the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia."
6629,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,Saturnalia?
6630,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,"Gather round, kids, it’s time for Sheldon’s beloved Christmas special."
6631,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"In the pre-Christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree."
6632,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,"And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about."
6633,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Okay, well, thank you for that, but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so I’ll just put them under my tree."
6634,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,Wait! You bought me a present?
6635,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,Uh-huh.
6636,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,Why would you do such a thing?
6637,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,I don’t know. ‘Cause it’s Christmas?
6638,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"Oh, Penny. I know you think you’re being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven’t given me a gift, you’ve given me an obligation."
6639,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,"Don’t feel bad, Penny, it’s a classic rookie mistake. My first Hanukkah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights."
6640,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Now, honey, it’s okay.You don’t have to get me anything in return."
6641,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you’ve given me. It’s no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.
6642,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Okay, you know what? Forget it. I’m not giving you a present."
6643,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"No, it’s too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps."
6644,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,I know. It’s funny when it’s not happening to us.
6645,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Sheldon, I am very, very sorry."
6646,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"No. No, I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. I’m going to need a ride to the mall."
6647,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,It’s happening to us.
6648,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,Ow! Ow!
6649,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,Are you gonna make it?
6650,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, I guess."
6651,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,All right.
6652,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.
6653,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,No problem.
6654,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me, didn’t it?"
6655,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,Yeah. Lucky for you it wasn’t moving.
6656,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay?"
6657,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, yeah. It’s just a little motorcycle accident."
6658,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"My God, how fast were you going?"
6659,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,I don’t know. It’s all such a blur.
6660,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,Ha ha ha. Good one. He couldn’t even get it started. Hi. Dave.
6661,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,Hi. Penny. So it’s your motorcycle?
6662,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,Uh-huh.
6663,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Oh, is it okay?"
6664,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,It’s fine.
6665,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg."
6666,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,You mind giving me a hand with speed racer here?
6667,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?"
6668,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,I’m a physicist.
6669,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Ha-ha. No, you’re not."
6670,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,Why is that so surprising?
6671,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Uh, well, it’s just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale."
6672,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,I’m not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don’t take melanoma lightly.
6673,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"So, are you and Leonard working on an experiment together?"
6674,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,"Yeah, actually we are."
6675,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, we’re examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector."
6676,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Uh, sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking. You know, I love science."
6677,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,Since when?
6678,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Since always. Call me a geek, but I am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing."
6679,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,The last thing I would ever call you is a geek.
6680,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Ha. Well, that’s what I am, queen of the nerds."
6681,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,"Well, if you like, I could show you the lab we’re working in. We’ve got some cool toys, you know, lasers and stuff."
6682,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab."
6683,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,Since when?
6684,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,Since always.
6685,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,"Leonard, are you okay here?"
6686,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Uh, yeah. I guess."
6687,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,"How ’bout we go see it now? Maybe afterwards we take the bike up the coast, we grab a little bite to eat…"
6688,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Um,yeah, yeah, that sounds great, let me just get my jacket."
6689,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,"Boy, she’ll do, huh?"
6690,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, if you like that type."
6691,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,"So, you and her?"
6692,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"No, just neighbours."
6693,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,Really. I don’t know how you live next door to that without doing something about it.
6694,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Actually, science is my lady."
6695,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,Okay. Let’s go.
6696,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,"All right. See you tomorrow, Leonard."
6697,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"See ya. ‘Bye, Penny. Have fun."
6698,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,Yes?
6699,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,Did you forget your key?
6700,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,I don’t see anything in here a woman would want.
6701,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,"You’re kidding. You’ve got lotions and bath oils and soaps, that’s the estrogen hat trick."
6702,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It’s as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan."
6703,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Raj,"Sheldon, if you don’t like this stuff, let’s just go next door and build her a bear."
6704,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"I told you before, bears are terrifying."
6705,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,"Come on, bath stuff, it’s perfect! You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation."
6706,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,That presupposes Penny is tense.
6707,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Raj,She knows you. She’s tense. We all are. Buy a basket!
6708,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,"Excuse me, we’re ready."
6709,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"No, we’re not. Let’s say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis, I now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?"
6710,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,This one. Let’s go.
6711,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,You put no thought into that.
6712,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,"I’m sorry. Uh, this one. Let’s go!"
6713,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"I have insufficient data to proceed. Excuse me, miss?"
6714,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Assistant,Yes?
6715,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"If I were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us."
6716,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Assistant,Excuse me?
6717,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"Here. Now, are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?"
6718,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Assistant,I don’t understand what you’re talking about and you’re making me a little uncomfortable.
6719,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,See? Sounds just like you and Penny. We’ll take it.
6720,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,"Hey, Leonard. Come, join us."
6721,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny, what a surprise."
6722,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Hey, Leonard. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know, this place is unbelievable!"
6723,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, I know. I’ve been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga."
6724,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,I never said that.
6725,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like yoga.
6726,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,"This is an amazing woman, Leonard. She has a curious and agile mind, not to mention being curious and agile in other respects."
6727,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Oh, shut up!"
6728,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Yes, please shut up. So, um, Dave, don’t you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know, that dark matter isn’t going to detect itself."
6729,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,"Actually, I was thinking about taking the afternoon off so I could work on another experiment with Penny."
6730,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,Really? We’re going to do an experiment?
6731,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,Uh-huh. We’re going to explore the effects of tequila shots on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.
6732,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,It’s not an experiment! You saw what happened last night.
6733,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,You ready to go?
6734,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah. Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?"
6735,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,David,"Yeah, why not? You can’t do any worse than Leonard."
6736,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"That’s funny. By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking."
6737,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"Mmm, great news, Leonard, I’ve solved my Penny gift dilemma."
6738,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,Yippee.
6739,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate, but I have devised a foolproof plan. See, I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress."
6740,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"Then I’ll look up the price of her gift online, choose the basket closest to that value, give it to her and then I’ll return the others for a full refund."
6741,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,Brilliant.
6742,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"It is, isn’t it? Is it okay if I hide them in your room? The smell makes me nauseated."
6743,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,Do whatever you want.
6744,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"Thank you, that’s very gracious.     Gentlemen."
6745,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Howard,Why couldn’t you have just done what Leonard did and get Penny a new boyfriend?
6746,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
6747,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn’t want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well, news flash, lady, David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! You’d have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him, I’m like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So, my question is, what’s up with that?"
6748,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,Why are you yelling at me?
6749,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Never mind, we’re cool."
6750,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,Dave is not smarter than you. He’s an idiot.
6751,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,Really? Why would you say that?
6752,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.
6753,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,He tried to take nude photos of you?
6754,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,That’s what you took from that? The guy is married!
6755,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, yeah. I’m so… oh, that’s terrible."
6756,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?"
6757,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Well, uh, the important thing is he’s married and that’s terrible!"
6758,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Nice save, genius. Eggnog?"
6759,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,Lactose.
6760,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,It’s just rum. It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.
6761,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,Smooth.
6762,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,Smoother than you.
6763,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Come on, it’s Christmas, just give me this one."
6764,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Okay, Merry Christmas."
6765,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking."
6766,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,Merry Christmas.
6767,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,Merry Christmas.
6768,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,How’s your leg?
6769,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in."
6770,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"Ah, good, Penny, you’re here to exchange gifts. You’ll be pleased to know I’m prepared for whatever you have to offer."
6771,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Okay, here."
6772,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"I should note I’m having some digestive distress, so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don’t be alarmed. Oh, a napkin."
6773,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,Turn it over.
6774,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"To Sheldon, live long and prosper. Leonard Nimoy."
6775,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the napkin’s dirty. He wiped his mouth with it."
6776,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!
6777,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Well, yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it."
6778,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!
6779,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Okay, all I’m giving you is the napkin, Sheldon."
6780,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,Be right back.
6781,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,Here. Open it.
6782,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful."
6783,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah, and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one."
6784,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, then, I think you’ll appreciate what I got you."
6785,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,Okay. 101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids.
6786,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,"You know, ’cause you’re so into science."
6787,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,Sheldon! What did you do?!
6788,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Sheldon,"I know! It’s not enough, is it? Here."
6789,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Penny,"Leonard, look! Sheldon’s hugging me."
6790,2,11,the bath item gift hypothesis,Leonard,It’s a Saturnalia miracle.
6791,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"All right, that’s the last servo. Behold the Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator. Or…"
6792,2,12,the killer robot instability,All,MONTE.
6793,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"Featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds."
6794,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?
6795,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"As with my father, I both love and fear it."
6796,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"All right, enough chitchat, let’s destroy something."
6797,2,12,the killer robot instability,Together,"One, two, three, go."
6798,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?
6799,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,Maybe we should start small.
6800,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"Okay. Ooh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what’s inside the Magic Eight Ball."
6801,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,Did it when I was four. It’s an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.
6802,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"Man, call spoiler alert before you say things like that."
6803,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,How about the toaster oven?
6804,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,What did the toaster oven ever do to you?
6805,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boys’ room at the wrong time."
6806,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"Gentlemen, goggles."
6807,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"Yeah, this is an auspicious moment. Yeah, like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event."
6808,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"How about “Die, toaster, die”?"
6809,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,That’ll do it.
6810,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"All right, what’s next?"
6811,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"No, I think I’m just going to stay in tonight and do laundry."
6812,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"Oh yeah, they still got the full Monte."
6813,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,Leonard?
6814,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,Uh-huh?
6815,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,What the hell?
6816,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,Killer robot. We built it.
6817,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Yeah, well, it almost killed me."
6818,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"If it wanted to kill you, you’d be dead."
6819,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"So, who exactly does it want to kill?"
6820,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?"
6821,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"You know, since I moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded."
6822,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,It’s a big deal. There’s an awards banquet and a dance afterward. Perhaps you’d like to come with me. I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.
6823,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,How is it supposed to be a dance if I’m the only girl?
6824,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. You’d be the only doable girl."
6825,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"You’re a pig, Howard."
6826,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,How is doable anything but a compliment?
6827,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Howard, why don’t we just work on the robot?"
6828,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"Please, Leonard, not now. Once again, Penny and I have begun our little tango."
6829,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,Our tango?
6830,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"The carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro. But as delicious as the appetizer might be, at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entree while it’s still… hot."
6831,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"I’m begging you, stop talking."
6832,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Look, normally I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it, you’re a little peculiar. You know, like Sheldon."
6833,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"Yeah, excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you’re the one who’s peculiar."
6834,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Yeah, you might be right. But back to you. I know you think you’re some sort of smooth-talking ladies’ man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy."
6835,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"Um, so what are you saying?"
6836,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It’s not sexy to stare at my ass and say, “Ooh, it must be jelly ’cause jam don’t shake like that.” And most important, we are not dancing a tango, we’re not to’ing and fro’ing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever."
6837,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"Wait a minute. This isn’t flirting, you’re serious."
6838,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Flirting? You think I’m flirting with you? I am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, you’re just gonna grow old and die alone."
6839,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,Thanks for the heads up.
6840,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Howard, where you going?"
6841,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"I’m going home to live my creepy, pathetic life."
6842,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,Wow.
6843,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Well, someone had to say it."
6844,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,What?
6845,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.
6846,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard’s Mother,"Howard, the phone is ringing!"
6847,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"Here’s a crazy idea, Ma, answer it!"
6848,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard’s Mother,"Hello? All right, hold on. It’s your friend, Leonard! He wants to know why you’re not at school today!"
6849,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"I don’t go to school, Ma. I work at a university."
6850,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard’s Mother,That’s a school! Now pick up the phone!
6851,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,I don’t want to talk to anybody.
6852,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard’s Mother,Should I ask Leonard to bring over your homework?!
6853,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,I don’t have homework. I’m a grown man with a master’s degree in engineering!
6854,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard’s Mother,"Excuse me, Mr. Fancy-Pants. Want me to get you a Popsicle?"
6855,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"Cherry, please!"
6856,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard’s Mother,I ate the cherry. All that’s left is green.
6857,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,You make me want to kill myself.
6858,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,What’s going on?
6859,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"I don’t know, now they’re just yelling about Popsicles. Sounds like Penny really got to him."
6860,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"I’m not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell, Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave, but he does it with real sensitivity."
6861,2,12,the killer robot instability,Kripke,"Hey, Hofstadter. Word around the pwasma wab is you built a wobot?"
6862,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Yes, we did, Kripke."
6863,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,His name is Monte.
6864,2,12,the killer robot instability,Kripke,"Well, if you have any dewusions about entewing him against my wobot, the Kwipke Kwippler in the Southern California Wobot Fighting League Wound Wobin Invitational, aka the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., his name is gonna be Swrap Metal."
6865,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Come on, is that really necessary?"
6866,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"Leonard, I believe it is. This is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. Kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I’m given to understand that your mother is overweight."
6867,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"Oh, snap."
6868,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"Now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment."
6869,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,What difference does it make? Fat is fat.
6870,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,There are boundaries.
6871,2,12,the killer robot instability,Kripke,"Tell you what, forget the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., let’s settle this woboto a woboto."
6872,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,What do you mean?
6873,2,12,the killer robot instability,Kripke,"There’s no guawantee we’ve gotta go against each other in the Wound Wobin, so let’s thwow down. You know, unless you’re afwaid."
6874,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.
6875,2,12,the killer robot instability,Kripke,"Tomowow, thwee o’clock, the kinetics wab."
6876,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,Make it so.
6877,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"No, don’t make it so. Barry, we can’t fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated."
6878,2,12,the killer robot instability,Kripke,What’s wrong with him?
6879,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,He’s depressed because he’s pathetic and creepy and he can’t get girls.
6880,2,12,the killer robot instability,Kripke,"We’re all pathetic and cweepy and can’t get girls, that’s why we fight wobots. If you’re not there, you’ll be exposed to widicule."
6881,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"I’m curious, what part of America is that accent from?"
6882,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,Hey.
6883,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Hey, you got a minute?"
6884,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Yeah, come on in. What’s up?"
6885,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,I need you to apologize to How…
6886,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,Get out.
6887,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,Come on. Wolowitz won’t come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.
6888,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Well, then have the robot go and get him."
6889,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,The robot didn’t hurt his feelings.
6890,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,His feelings needed to be hurt.
6891,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,He’s been in bed for two days.
6892,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll."
6893,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,He’s not with a… does it really matter who or what he’s with? The guy is devastated.
6894,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Oh, please, how could I possibly devastate Howard?"
6895,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Okay, don’t take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on."
6896,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,What does that mean?
6897,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"You know, like, most of the time, you’re the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!"
6898,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,I turn into a bear?
6899,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn’t get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him."
6900,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"And say what? That I didn’t mean it, because I meant it."
6901,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine."
6902,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Oh, pthththth."
6903,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Okay, let’s try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend’s apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said… what was that? What did you say? Oh, yes, you said you owed me one."
6904,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Okay, come on, that’s not fair."
6905,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,I came home with no pants.
6906,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Fine, I’ll go over there tomorrow."
6907,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,Thank you. I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.
6908,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,What about her?
6909,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,She’s a delightful woman. You’ll love her.
6910,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard’s Mother,"Howard, there’s a blonde girl, Patsy, here to see you!"
6911,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,Who?
6912,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard’s Mother,"Okay, now she’s saying it’s Penny."
6913,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,I don’t want to talk to her.
6914,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,Hey.
6915,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,Ma!
6916,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard’s Mother,She ran past me. Was I supposed to tackle her?
6917,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"So, I just came by to see how you were doing."
6918,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,I’m fine.
6919,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,Good. Your mom seems nice.
6920,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,People move away from her on the bus. What do you want?
6921,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Okay, look. Howard, I just want to apologize for some things that I have said. About you. I’ve been informed that you have feelings. And apparently, I have hurt them. So, I’m sorry. Howard."
6922,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"Fine, you’re sorry. Good-bye."
6923,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"So, you’re okay?"
6924,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"Hey, I’m a big boy. I’m not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. I mean, get over yourself."
6925,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Okay. Well, bye."
6926,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Oh, my God. That’s Kripke’s robot?"
6927,2,12,the killer robot instability,Kripke,"As you can see, the Kwippler is weducing the Chevy Cavawier to wubble."
6928,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,I can’t watch anymore.
6929,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Sheldon, we have to call it off."
6930,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"We don’t have that option, we’ve accepted the challenge. We can’t run away from a fight."
6931,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Oh, please, we’ve spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size."
6932,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear."
6933,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke’s robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile."
6934,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we’re up against and we can modify Monte so that he’s prepared.
6935,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,You want to prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.
6936,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"Excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz? Have you heard from Penny yet?"
6937,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,Not yet.
6938,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"Have faith, gentlemen. We don’t need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?"
6939,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"And then, when I was 14, I met Marcy Grossman. She was so beautiful. She just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite. It was so hot, like a sexy little chipmunk. I didn’t have the courage to ask her out, but I dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show."
6940,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Aw, that sounds sweet."
6941,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"Marcy Grossman is sunshine, on a cloudy day, when it’s cold outside, Marcy Grossman is the month of May…"
6942,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Oh, it’s cute."
6943,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"I guess you’d say, what can make me feel this way, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Talkin’ ’bout Marcy…"
6944,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,That’s great.
6945,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,Grossman.
6946,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Oh, it’s fun."
6947,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,And then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair. Which brings us to tenth grade.
6948,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?"
6949,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,Look at me. What chance do I have if I don’t try too hard?
6950,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Well, you’d have a terrific chance. I mean, you’re smart, you’re funny, you have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space."
6951,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,I guess.
6952,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Look, I’m telling you, I’ve known you for, like, a year and a half and this is the first time I feel like I’m talking to a real person. And you know what? I like him, he’s a nice guy."
6953,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,You really think so?
6954,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,Yes.
6955,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,I don’t know.
6956,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,I do.
6957,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,Nice little bot you’ve got here.
6958,2,12,the killer robot instability,Kripke,I’m aware.
6959,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"What’s this do, spin?"
6960,2,12,the killer robot instability,Kripke,Yep. At 3400 RPM. It can cut through steel like it was wubber.
6961,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Neat. Good work. Sheldon, we’ve got to call this off."
6962,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"No, Leonard. For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now."
6963,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"But, Sheldon, we don’t have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote."
6964,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robot’s massive size and its overwhelming power."
6965,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"That’s not overconfidence, that’s observation."
6966,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. Kripke! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met."
6967,2,12,the killer robot instability,Kripke,What is his pwoblem?
6968,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks, dude."
6969,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"I just want to make sure that we’re all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply."
6970,2,12,the killer robot instability,Kripke,"Are you cwazy? This is a stweet fight, the stweet has no rules."
6971,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"He’s right, Leonard. The paradigm is to the death."
6972,2,12,the killer robot instability,Kripke,"I will, however, give you the opportunity to concede my supewiowity now and offer me your wobot as the spoils of war."
6973,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,Never. I’d rather see Monte dead than in your hands.
6974,2,12,the killer robot instability,Kripke,"That could be easily awanged. Weady, set, go?"
6975,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,Do it.
6976,2,12,the killer robot instability,Kripke,Alwight then. Weady. Set. Go.
6977,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"Come on, Sheldon, you got this."
6978,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us.
6979,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,That’s new.
6980,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Run, Monte, run!"
6981,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"Go, Monte! Go Monte!"
6982,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Go, go, go, go!"
6983,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"Don’t hurt us, don’t hurt us,"
6984,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,"Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood."
6985,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"I did this. Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. No matter what anybody says, this is my fault."
6986,2,12,the killer robot instability,Raj,"No one’s arguing with you, dude."
6987,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,I got your text. How bad is… Oy.
6988,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,Forget the robot. What happened to you?
6989,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,He slipped and fell.
6990,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"Yes, I slipped and fell. In the bathroom. Bounced right off the tub."
6991,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don’t treat them with respect."
6992,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,Yeah. They sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.
6993,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"So what do you think, Howard? It’s not that bad, right?"
6994,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"Oh, no. A little electrical tape, some solder. Are you insane? I’ve seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this."
6995,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,"You’re right. Monte’s gone. We’ll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I’ll speak. Leonard, you’ll play your cello."
6996,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"Sheldon, honey, aren’t you getting a little carried away? I mean, it’s just a toy robot."
6997,2,12,the killer robot instability,Sheldon,Just a toy robot?
6998,2,12,the killer robot instability,Leonard,Penny.
6999,2,12,the killer robot instability,Penny,"I know, I got it. Sheldon, I’m sorry."
7000,2,12,the killer robot instability,Howard,"Well, don’t get the wrong idea. The way I see it, I’m halfway to pity sex."
7001,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Raj,"Mmm, gentlemen, I put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour."
7002,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"First off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. It is extracted from the plant…"
7003,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,"Hey, I’m thinking of growing a mustache."
7004,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?"
7005,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,It is extracted from the plant…
7006,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,"I’m not sure yet. You know, George Clooney has one now!"
7007,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Raj,Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph’s. He was buying tequila.
7008,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,"Oh, you’d think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey."
7009,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"Alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes."
7010,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,"Alright Sheldon, why is tapioca…"
7011,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.
7012,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Raj,Feel better now?
7013,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"It is also indigenous to Brazil, as is the Cocoa Bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. And you promised you wouldn’t do that anymore!"
7014,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,Hey Hofstadter!
7015,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,Hey Kripke.
7016,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"Heard about your watest pwoton decay expewiment, twenty thousand data wuns and no statistically significant wesults. Vewy impwessive!"
7017,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,What a jerk.
7018,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Raj,"Don’t feel bad Leonard, negative results are still results."
7019,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,Even twenty thousand of ’em.
7020,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"Alright, please don’t cheer me up anymore."
7021,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,"C’mon, don’t let him get to you. It’s Kripke."
7022,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Raj,"Yeah, he’s a ginormous knob."
7023,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,"That’s why he eats by himself, instead of sitting here at the cool table."
7024,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Raj,Fo’ shizzle.
7025,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Hey it’s true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe."
7026,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.
7027,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Well then, the solution is simple. I shall befriend him. Kripke!"
7028,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,Yeah?
7029,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,What’d you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?
7030,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"I would say, I have no intewest in becoming your fwiend."
7031,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why don’t you take some time to reconsider?"
7032,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"Yeah, I’ll do that."
7033,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,Well I think we’re off to a terrific start.
7034,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,There you go. Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.
7035,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesn’t bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.
7036,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"Yeah, I got the same one. And that’s not a bathing suit, it’s a tan line."
7037,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Hello. This is Sheldon Cooper. I’m leaving a message for Barry Kripke. Barry, It was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria. I saw that you purchased the chef’s salad. Apparently, you did not know that the chef’s salad is kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it. I’m following up on our pending friendship, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status. Sheldon Cooper."
7038,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,What’s up with Ichabod?
7039,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,Oh he’s trying to make a new friend.
7040,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,"Oh really? Well, good for him."
7041,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"Well, unless he’s makes one out of wood like Gepetto, I don’t think it’s gonna happen."
7042,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,"Well, how did you guys become friends?"
7043,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.
7044,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,And you moved in anyway?
7045,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,I assumed he was joking. You’d be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.
7046,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,"Well, what about Howard and Raj, I mean how did you become friends with them?"
7047,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"I don’t know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons."
7048,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,"Well yeah, sure. When you put it that way. But it all worked out, right?"
7049,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,I suppose. I do miss whistling though.
7050,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,"Oh come on, really?"
7051,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,First warning.
7052,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny.This is for you."
7053,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,Hello Sheldon.
7054,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,Hi.
7055,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,What is this?
7056,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"It’s a questionnaire I devised. I’m having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so I’m doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me."
7057,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,"Yes. Well, that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?"
7058,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do."
7059,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,"Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?"
7060,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. Why don’t you just go ahead and write that number 1. I’m afraid you’re on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours."
7061,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,Wait! How many questions are on this thing?
7062,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Only 211. Don’t worry, in deference to you, I’ve kept them on a high school graduate reading level."
7063,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,Thanks pal.
7064,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"You got it, buddy."
7065,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,"Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I don’t know, pleasant?"
7066,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,Well that’s certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.
7067,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Your questionnaire, very disappointing."
7068,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,I answered every question Sheldon.
7069,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.
7070,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"Aw, you picked up on that huh?"
7071,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,How could I not?
7072,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"Come on! There’s over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?"
7073,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"There are a number of acceptable answers, for example, C:  near earth transport, but certainly not B: avocado rancher. And your essay, suggesting that I’d have better luck making friends if I wait ’til the Cylons take over? Please."
7074,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,Hold on. I put some real work into that!
7075,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Yes, well it’s better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum."
7076,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"It’s kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum."
7077,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?
7078,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m not going to defend a big-balled raccoon."
7079,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,I don’t see how you could.
7080,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"What I’m trying to say is that, maybe you can’t approach this as a purely intellectual exercise."
7081,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,What do you mean!?
7082,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?"
7083,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,I did learn how to swim.
7084,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,On the floor.
7085,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.
7086,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,Then why learn how to swim?
7087,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isn’t going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I don’t have to break new ground here, I’m sure much of the research already exists."
7088,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives."
7089,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,That’s insane on the face of it. Come on.
7090,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,Where are we going?
7091,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,You’re driving me to the mall. I’m going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.
7092,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,Why don’t you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
7093,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,Coping with the death of a loved one. My condolences.
7094,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Woman in queue,Thank you.
7095,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,Family or friend?
7096,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Woman,Family.
7097,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Too bad. If it’d been a friend, I’m available to fill the void."
7098,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"It’s just as well, she smelled like moth balls."
7099,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"Okay, if you’re gonna start sniffing people, I’m gonna go get a hot pretzel."
7100,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?
7101,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Bookstore employee,"Um, yeah but they’re all for little kids."
7102,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.
7103,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Employee,"Uh, I guess. They’re right over there by the wooden train set."
7104,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,Oh! I love trains!
7105,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Employee,I bet you do.
7106,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Oh my! That’s awfully sticky. Alright, let’s see. Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now. It’s probably about homosexual rabbits. Jerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus. Read it, not helpful. Oh! Here we go. Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo. Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her husband and best friend Mark, and their cockatoos too. Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn’t you agree?"
7107,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Little girl,"I don’t like birds, they scare me."
7108,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,Me too! Most people don’t see it. What are you reading?
7109,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Girl,Curious George.
7110,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,Oh I do like monkeys!
7111,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Girl,Curious George is a monkey.
7112,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?"
7113,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Girl,Okay.
7114,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"Sheldon, what are you doing?"
7115,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,I’m making friends with this little girl. What’s your name?
7116,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Girl,Rebecca.
7117,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Hi Rebecca, I’m your new friend, Sheldon."
7118,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"No you’re not, let’s go."
7119,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,We were really hitting it off.
7120,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"Don’t look up, there’s cameras."
7121,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Raj,"I’m curious. In the “How Well Do You Know Sheldon” section, what do you put for his favourite amino acid?"
7122,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard and Howard,Lysine.
7123,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Raj,Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.
7124,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,Oh good! You’re just in time. I believe I’ve isolated the algorithm for making friends.
7125,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!"
7126,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,"Hear him out. If he’s really on to something, we can open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune."
7127,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"See, my initial approach to Kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo."
7128,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Raj,Stu the cockatoo?
7129,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"Yes, he’s new at the zoo."
7130,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,It’s a terrific book. I’ve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.
7131,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,Have you thought about putting him in a crate while you’re out of the apartment?
7132,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Hello, Kripke. Yes, Sheldon Cooper here. It occurred to me you hadn’t returned any of my calls because I hadn’t offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together… I see. Well then perhaps you’d have time for a hot beverage. Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa… I see. No, no, no, wait. Don’t hang up yet. What about a recreational activity? I bet we share some common interests. Tell me an interest of yours. Really? On actual horses? Tell me another interest of yours. Oh no, I’m sorry, I have no desire to get in the water until I absolutely have to. Tell me another interest of yours."
7133,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,"Uh-oh, he’s stuck in an infinite loop."
7134,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,I can fix it.
7135,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Mmhmm. Mmhmm. It’s interesting. But isn’t ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on, Kripke."
7136,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable activity! Howard, that’s brilliant! I’m surprised you saw that."
7137,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,Gee. Why can’t Sheldon make friends?
7138,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, I’ll pay. Alright, goodbye. Alright! Time to learn rock climbing."
7139,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while you drink."
7140,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"Nope, I wanna climb some wocks."
7141,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. No, one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons."
7142,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"You afwaid of heights, Cooper?"
7143,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?"
7144,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"Come on, they have birthday parties here. Wittle kids climb this."
7145,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Little kid Hominids, perhaps."
7146,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud.
7147,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"Let’s go, Cooper."
7148,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said that’s to be expected. Hey, this isn’t so bad. A bit like vertical swimming."
7149,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"Hey, look at you, Cooper. You’re almost halfway to the top."
7150,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.
7151,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"You alwight there, Cooper?"
7152,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that’s approaching an asymptote.
7153,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,Are you saying you’re stuck?
7154,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?
7155,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,Understood all that. I’m not a mowon. Just keep going.
7156,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Yeah, I don’t think I can."
7157,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"Well, then. Cwimb back down."
7158,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"No, that doesn’t seem any more likely."
7159,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"So what’s the pwan, Cooper?"
7160,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Well, it’s not exactly a plan but I think I’m going to pass out."
7161,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,I’m sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?
7162,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,"Okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and…"
7163,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,It’s a little thing but you really do miss it.
7164,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner."
7165,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Together,Oh…
7166,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"Hewo to you, too."
7167,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,How was rock climbing?
7168,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,He passed out. Just hung there like a big sawami.
7169,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,D-d-d! That’s where I sit.
7170,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"Ooh, you have a special spot. What kind of wacko are you?"
7171,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,How much time you got?
7172,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,Want some Chinese food?
7173,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,Tewific. Got any dental fwoss?
7174,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,In the bathroom.
7175,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,Be right back. I gotta fwoss the Indian food out of my teeth if I’m gonna eat Chinese.
7176,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,"Sheldon, are you okay?"
7177,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. I’ve made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment."
7178,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,What’s that?
7179,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So, I’m going to have to let one of you go."
7180,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,"Me, me. Let it be me."
7181,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. You are safe."
7182,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,Can I whistle?
7183,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Don’t be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you’re not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays."
7184,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,Guilty as charged. I’m out.
7185,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"No. You, too, are safe."
7186,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,Oh come on. What do I have to do?
7187,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. I’m not one of you guys. I’m not a scientist. So just…
7188,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you’re saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, you’re out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?"
7189,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,He had Lysine but changed it.
7190,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj."
7191,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"I like to fwoss before I eat, so my gum pockets are open for new food."
7192,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,Eww.
7193,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,Hewo. How did I walk past you? I’m Bawy.
7194,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Penny,Penny.
7195,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"Yeah, it’s not a vewy hot name. I’m gonna call your Woxanne. Ooh, pot stickers."
7196,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,"Suddenly I’m looking pretty good, huh?"
7197,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if there’s any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer."
7198,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,No.
7199,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,No? But we’re friends!
7200,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"I’m sowy. No, my fwiend?"
7201,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,I’m confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?
7202,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Kripke,"No, that’s wong. There’s an official schedule. I have no contwol over it."
7203,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Sheldon,"Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj, you’re back in. He likes monkeys."
7204,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Howard,You gotta give him credit for sticking with it.
7205,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Leonard,I didn’t think he had it in him.
7206,2,13,the friendship algorithm,Raj,He almost made it to the top this time.
7207,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Hmmm.
7208,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,The problem appears to be unsolvable.
7209,2,14,the financial permeability,Raj,Maybe you could run some computer simulations.
7210,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,There are too many variables. It would take forever.
7211,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"We’ve got to be missing something. Let’s start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45"
7212,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"Right, these theatres have to be eliminated."
7213,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Why? They’re state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound."
7214,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add."
7215,2,14,the financial permeability,Raj,What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.
7216,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.
7217,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Well, it’s gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I don’t see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre."
7218,2,14,the financial permeability,Raj,We could eat after the movie.
7219,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning’s bowel movement occurring at work."
7220,2,14,the financial permeability,Raj,"Hang on, hang on. There’s a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here."
7221,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,Wow. I don’t see how we missed that.
7222,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?"
7223,2,14,the financial permeability,Raj,That’s how we missed it.
7224,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?"
7225,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, you know I can’t do that."
7226,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,"Okay, I guess we only have one option."
7227,2,14,the financial permeability,Raj,"Yep, I don’t see any way around it."
7228,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Bye, Sheldon."
7229,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,See ya.
7230,2,14,the financial permeability,Raj,"Later, dude."
7231,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"They’re right, it was the only option."
7232,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door."
7233,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Why?
7234,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,Just do it!
7235,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"Well, you didn’t specify."
7236,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,Is Leonard around?
7237,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I’m sorry, I don’t understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?"
7238,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"The building manager’s showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven’t paid my rent."
7239,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"Oh, I see. Penny, I’m not sure I’m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation."
7240,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,It’s no big deal. I’m just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.
7241,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"If you recall, I pointed out the “check engine” light to you several months ago."
7242,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,Well the “check engine” light is fine. It’s still blinking away. It’s the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.
7243,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money."
7244,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Yes, it occurs to me, too."
7245,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Hang on a moment.
7246,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.
7247,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Wow, you got a lot of money in there."
7248,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,That’s why it’s guarded by snakes. Take some.
7249,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,Don’t be silly.
7250,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,I’m never silly. Here.
7251,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"No, I can’t."
7252,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Don’t you need money?
7253,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Well, yeah, but…"
7254,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,This is money I’m not using.
7255,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,But what if you need it?
7256,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some."
7257,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Really? I mean, are you sure?"
7258,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.
7259,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,Are they working on that?
7260,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,I sincerely hope so.
7261,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I can’t. Sheldon honey, I don’t want things to be weird between us."
7262,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Won’t it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you’re living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?
7263,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,I’ll pay you back as soon as I can.
7264,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Of course you will. It’s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.
7265,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,I’m regretting this already.
7266,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"You know, I’ve given the matter some thought, and I think I’d be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens."
7267,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Interesting.
7268,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Ask me why.
7269,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Do I have to?
7270,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Of course. That’s how you move a conversation forward.
7271,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Why?
7272,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched."
7273,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Hey, Penny. How was work?"
7274,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,Great. I hope I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.
7275,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Was that sarcasm?
7276,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,No.
7277,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Was that sarcasm?
7278,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,Yes.
7279,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Was that sarca..
7280,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Stop it!
7281,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"Penny, you appear to have a package here."
7282,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered."
7283,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women’s fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.
7284,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"He’s not lying, he does find that fascinating."
7285,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Okay, whatever. It’s not like I’m running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?"
7286,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,All right.
7287,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?"
7288,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Weird.
7289,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasn’t sure."
7290,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Did you guys have an argument?
7291,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,No.
7292,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her."
7293,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"I’m at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there’s a blunder I overlooked."
7294,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up."
7295,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,It’s getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.
7296,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce."
7297,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Thank you, Leonard. What’s my share?"
7298,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Don’t worry about it. It’s my treat.
7299,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"No, really, how much?"
7300,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"It’s, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars."
7301,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Well, which is it, ten or eleven?"
7302,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Fourteen fifty, but it’s no biggie, you’ll get the next one."
7303,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,What?
7304,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he’d get his shrimp lo mein for free.
7305,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,What are you saying? That I’m using my body to get dinner? That I’m some kind of Chinese food prostitute?
7306,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,"Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?"
7307,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"‘Cause let me tell you something, buddy, I pay my own way in this world, okay? I don’t rely on anybody!"
7308,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,What was that about?
7309,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,He has a nervous bladder when he’s stressed out. Kind of like a puppy.
7310,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Here, Leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars."
7311,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"It was fourteen fifty, but it’s okay."
7312,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"Oh, good. Dinner’s here."
7313,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Yes, dinner’s here, and I’m having some. I’m having takeout food."
7314,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Okay.
7315,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"You’re damn right it’s okay. I’ve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me."
7316,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit."
7317,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time."
7318,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Oh, wait, you lent her money?"
7319,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.
7320,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn’t you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can’t pay her bills."
7321,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Where are you going?
7322,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Going home, where I won’t be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie."
7323,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"In case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that I’ve moved my money out of the snake can."
7324,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"But if you’re ever short, there’s always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern’s ass."
7325,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Hey.
7326,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,Hey.
7327,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"A little mood lighting, huh?"
7328,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Yeah. When I didn’t pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience."
7329,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Yeah, they’re very considerate that way."
7330,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"I used Sheldon’s money to pay my rent, then I had like fourteen dollars left over."
7331,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Fourteen dollars, huh?"
7332,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Put it back in your pocket, or I’ll find some other place to put it."
7333,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn’t care when he gets the money back. It’s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn’t make you want to, you know, kill him."
7334,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Yeah, well, that’s not really my big problem."
7335,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,So you’re a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.
7336,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Yeah, I know, it’s just, this wasn’t the plan, it wasn’t supposed to go this way."
7337,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Well, what was the plan?"
7338,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star."
7339,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Was there a plan B?
7340,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,TV star.
7341,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"It’s probably not as bad as you think. Let’s take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here’s something, if you don’t have electricity, then you probably don’t need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?"
7342,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Oh, no, I can’t give up my acting classes. I’m a professional actress."
7343,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,You’ve had an acting job where you got paid?
7344,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,That is not the definition of professional.
7345,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Actually, it kind of… let’s keep looking. Whoa, what’s eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?"
7346,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Oh, that’s nothing."
7347,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour."
7348,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Well, remember Kurt?"
7349,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Your ex-boyfriend?
7350,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.
7351,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,What?
7352,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,He was drunk.
7353,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,I would hope so.
7354,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines."
7355,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Did he pay you back?
7356,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"No, but he will."
7357,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,And that’s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?
7358,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Leonard, I’m not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money."
7359,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Well what are you gonna do?
7360,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"I don’t know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live."
7361,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Oh, no. Oh, you don’t want to do that."
7362,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,Why not?
7363,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they’re not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it’s just, like… Why don’t you just get a roommate and stay here?"
7364,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Well, do you know anybody?"
7365,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Well, I’m sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn’t mind moving in with you."
7366,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together, I wouldn’t be able to keep my hands off you."
7367,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Really?
7368,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.
7369,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,Ugh. This mu-shu pork’s burning a hole through my duodenum.
7370,2,14,the financial permeability,Raj,"Leviticus 11,3, “Only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.”"
7371,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,"Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita every time you scarf down a Whopper?"
7372,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Hey, what’s going on?"
7373,2,14,the financial permeability,Raj,We’re on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.
7374,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,You want the Valley of Fire? It’s right here.
7375,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?"
7376,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Outside? I just made cocoa.
7377,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,– Come on. It’ll be fun.
7378,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,What is it?
7379,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Do you guys remember Penny’s ex-boyfriend Kurt?
7380,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Yeah, that’s him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I’m gonna go get it from him."
7381,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Who’s with me?
7382,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,"Ooh, double sixes."
7383,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Really? You’re just gonna let me go by myself?
7384,2,14,the financial permeability,Raj,"Oh, cool, I got a sword."
7385,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,I could use some help.
7386,2,14,the financial permeability,Raj,Here.
7387,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there’s real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out."
7388,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?"
7389,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,I do.
7390,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don’t.
7391,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,I’m not afraid of him.
7392,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny’s steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us."
7393,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn’t Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?"
7394,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,They did.
7395,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Well?
7396,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"They had a terrible time of it, Leonard."
7397,2,14,the financial permeability,Raj,"Plus, no one stole their pants."
7398,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Fine. Just enjoy your little game. I’ll make this quest on my own.
7399,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,"Leonard, wait. Take a jacket, it’s spritzing a little."
7400,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,You guys suck.
7401,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Come on, please? He’s so big."
7402,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?"
7403,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,"Yes. Koothrappali’s going to wet himself, I’m gonna throw up, Sheldon’s gonna run away, and you’re going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?"
7404,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Guys, there are four of us and one of him."
7405,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.
7406,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Okay, how about this? I’ll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable."
7407,2,14,the financial permeability,Raj,I should’ve peed before we left.
7408,2,14,the financial permeability,Kurt,Yeah?
7409,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Hi, Kurt."
7410,2,14,the financial permeability,Kurt,"Lenny, right?"
7411,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"I don’t really go by Lenny, but that’s okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj."
7412,2,14,the financial permeability,Kurt,No. What do you want?
7413,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,You don’t remember me? How could he not remember me?
7414,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Sheldon, not now."
7415,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,I remember him.
7416,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Okay, here it is. Penny’s in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems."
7417,2,14,the financial permeability,Kurt,And she sent you to get it from me?
7418,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"No, no, she’s too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt."
7419,2,14,the financial permeability,Kurt,You do?
7420,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Feel is a kind of a… it’s a strong word. Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part."
7421,2,14,the financial permeability,Kurt,She’ll get it when she gets it.
7422,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,"Well, there you go. Problem solved."
7423,2,14,the financial permeability,Raj,A successful quest. Now let’s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.
7424,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"No, the problem isn’t solved. He just blew us off."
7425,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,I’ve got it. He didn’t remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.
7426,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,"Come on, Leonard, let’s go"
7427,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,No. You can leave if you want to. I’m gonna see this through.
7428,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,Okay.
7429,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"I guess, technically, that was my fault."
7430,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,I’m not leaving here without Penny’s money.
7431,2,14,the financial permeability,Kurt,What happened to your backup?
7432,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,I don’t need backup. I have right on my side. And I’m wearing cargo shorts under my pants.
7433,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt."
7434,2,14,the financial permeability,Howard,Maybe we should have your head notarized.
7435,2,14,the financial permeability,Raj,"If anybody cares, I still have to pee."
7436,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Hey.
7437,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Hey, is Sheldon here?"
7438,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!
7439,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,Nice hat.
7440,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,It’s kind of a fashionable look these days.
7441,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,Maybe if you’re working on a tuna boat.
7442,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"Hello, Penny."
7443,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot."
7444,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
7445,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,No.
7446,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,Darn. I can’t seem to get the hang of that.
7447,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,"Hey, I know it’s none of my business, but where did the money come from?"
7448,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me."
7449,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Really? Did he say why?
7450,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right."
7451,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,That’s it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?
7452,2,14,the financial permeability,Penny,"Nope. I just think he’s really changed. We’re having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys."
7453,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Bye.
7454,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesn’t seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it’s his nature."
7455,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Penny’s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!
7456,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"That’s your badge of honour, your warrior’s wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you."
7457,2,14,the financial permeability,Leonard,Great.
7458,2,14,the financial permeability,Sheldon,"There once was a brave lad named Leonard, with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee. He faced a fearsome giant, while Raj just wanted to pee."
7459,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Fellas, please."
7460,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,"Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound."
7461,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,You found it. It’s the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.
7462,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"I’m really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation."
7463,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,What’s that about?
7464,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,Not a clue.
7465,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Can’t we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?
7466,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,"This should be fairly easy to deduce. He’s holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he’s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller."
7467,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"No, I didn’t realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there’s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it."
7468,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,"He’s referring to an activity he has done before. It’s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy."
7469,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Aren’t there any other options? There’s not a lot of room, it’s gonna be uncomfortable."
7470,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,"Yes, yes. Yeah, I’m definitely going with colonoscopy."
7471,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Okay, bye. My mother’s coming to visit."
7472,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,"How about that, you were right."
7473,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,It’s out of order.
7474,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Woman,"Yes, I can read the sign, I’m just pondering the implications."
7475,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,I think it implies that the elevator doesn’t work.
7476,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Woman,"Again, I can read the sign. But the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust, which indicates that the elevator has been non-functional for a significant amount of time. Which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I assume, 24 to 36 residents of this building based on the number of mailboxes and given typical urban population density or a shared delusion of functionality."
7477,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,You must be Leonard’s mother.
7478,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard’s Mother,"Oh, I don’t know if I must be, but yes."
7479,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Uh, I’m Penny. I’m his neighbour."
7480,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard’s Mother,"Oh, Dr. Beverley Hofstadter."
7481,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Oh, nice to meet you."
7482,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Oh, you’re a hand shaker. Interesting."
7483,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Uh, why don’t you come with me. I’ll walk you to the apartment."
7484,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Oh, all right. Would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way?"
7485,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Yeah, sure, I guess."
7486,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"All right, you start."
7487,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Okay. You know, I’ve always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?"
7488,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Oh, I think you mean young. He’s always been little."
7489,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?"
7490,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,You’ll have to be more specific.
7491,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five."
7492,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Oh, well, at that age he was well enmeshed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development. An outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis."
7493,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist."
7494,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Well, that is one of my degrees. My primary field is neuroscience."
7495,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Oh, well, I’m an actress."
7496,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Why?
7497,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,What do you mean why?
7498,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Well, there are studies that suggest that many who go into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity."
7499,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Yeah, I don’t know what that means."
7500,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Well, it means you value yourself only as others value you, which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs."
7501,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood."
7502,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Tell me about it.
7503,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!"
7504,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"And then, I’m assuming, you entered adolescence."
7505,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn’t Slugger anymore. Your mother’s here!"
7506,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"If you want to have intercourse with that girl, find out what kind of cologne her father wore."
7507,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Good to see you, Mother."
7508,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Here’s your tea, Mother."
7509,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Oolong?
7510,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Yes.
7511,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Loose, not bagged?"
7512,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Yes.
7513,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Steeped three minutes?
7514,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Yes.
7515,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Two-percent milk?
7516,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Yes.
7517,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Warmed separately?
7518,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Yes.
7519,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,One teaspoon sugar?
7520,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Yes.
7521,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Raw sugar?
7522,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Yes.
7523,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,It’s cold.
7524,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,I’ll start again.
7525,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.
7526,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Oh, I don’t know where he would’ve gotten that. Aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage, his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction."
7527,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.
7528,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Yes, we think so. We’ve both done papers on it. Mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological. Mine, of course, was the only one worth reading."
7529,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.
7530,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Well, it’s all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press."
7531,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Here’s your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?"
7532,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.
7533,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Swell. If you’re lucky, maybe she’ll show you the PowerPoint presentation."
7534,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"I’m sorry, it’s on my other laptop."
7535,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,Aw…
7536,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"So, Mother, what’s new?"
7537,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,You’ll have to be more specific.
7538,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"All right. Uh, what’s new with you?"
7539,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Oh, well, I’ve been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently."
7540,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Maybe something less personal.
7541,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Oh. Your Uncle Floyd died.
7542,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Oh, my God. What happened?"
7543,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,His heart stopped beating. I have to urinate.
7544,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,What a remarkable woman.
7545,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off."
7546,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,I envy you your childhood.
7547,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd."
7548,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,"You’re clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I’m betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn’t eat your Brussels sprouts."
7549,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Sheldon, you don’t give your mother enough credit. She’s warm, she’s loving, she doesn’t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training."
7550,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,"You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes."
7551,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,"So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister."
7552,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Please, don’t go there, Howard."
7553,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,"I understand that unlike Leonard, they’re at the top of their respective fields."
7554,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Boy, you suck."
7555,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Well, Leonard’s younger brother, Michael, is a tenured law professor at Harvard, and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon."
7556,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,"So, she’s close to curing diabetes?"
7557,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?
7558,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,"Wow, you must be very proud."
7559,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Why? They’re not my accomplishments. I have to urinate.
7560,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Why are you doing this?
7561,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,"You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer."
7562,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,"Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you."
7563,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Raj,"Yeah, you’re like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family."
7564,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,"Oh, meesa think yousa lookin’ so so sad."
7565,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it."
7566,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Raj,"Nope, I think mocking you is more fun."
7567,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,"Next time, don’t yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?"
7568,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,That was fast.
7569,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Oh, the middle stall was occupied. I’ll have to try again later."
7570,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,"It’s totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it’s location, location, location."
7571,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"So, where were we?"
7572,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Howard lives with his mother and Raj can’t speak to women unless he’s drunk. Go.
7573,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"That’s fascinating. Selective mutism is quite rare. On the other hand, an adult Jewish male living with his mother is so common it borders on sociological cliché."
7574,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,"It’s just temporary, I pay rent."
7575,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.
7576,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"You know, both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one’s mother can stem from a pathological fear of women. It might explain why the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy."
7577,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,Say what?
7578,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,That’s basically what I just said.
7579,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha."
7580,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Leonard, it’s one o’clock, weren’t you going to show me your laboratory at one o’clock?"
7581,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"There’s no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other."
7582,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"But it’s one o’clock, you were going to show me your laboratory at one o’clock."
7583,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o’clock.
7584,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Fine. Let’s go. I think you’ll find my work pretty interesting. I’m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.
7585,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"So, no original research?"
7586,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,No.
7587,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Well, what’s the point of my seeing it? I could just read the paper the Italians wrote."
7588,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,"Just for the record, we’re not in an ersatz homosexual relationship."
7589,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Raj,"Well, then why didn’t you say that to her?"
7590,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,Why is it always my responsibility?
7591,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Raj,"It’s not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week."
7592,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,I can’t believe you’re bringing that up.
7593,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Raj,I didn’t bring it up. You did.
7594,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Howard,We’ll talk about this later.
7595,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Raj,"You always say that, but we never do."
7596,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,You went to the comic book store without me.7
7597,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,Hey.
7598,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,You got alcohol?
7599,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,Your mom still here?
7600,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Yep.
7601,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Come on in. Wait, wait, she’s not gonna come here looking for you, is she?"
7602,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan."
7603,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Oh, my God. What happened?"
7604,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
7605,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Geez, what a fun couple."
7606,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,She’s only been here a day and a half and I’m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.
7607,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I’ve been half bombed ever since."
7608,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,You can’t let her get into your head.
7609,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"My head, what about yours?"
7610,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,It’s too late for me. My head is her summer house.
7611,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me."
7612,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom."
7613,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I’ll finally get my daddy’s approval?"
7614,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Did you get the part?
7615,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"No, they said I was too perky."
7616,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?"
7617,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn’t let go. Your mother told me."
7618,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Of course she did. Anyway, that’s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine."
7619,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,A hugging machine?
7620,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Yeah. I got a dressmaker’s mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back."
7621,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Oh, that is so sad."
7622,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,You know what the saddest part was?
7623,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,What?
7624,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,My father used to borrow it.
7625,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Your scan data will be very elpful to my research. You have a remarkable brain.
7626,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,I know. Although I’ve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.
7627,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Common complaint among men. Nothing’s ever big enough, except when they get a tumour. Then you never hear the end of it."
7628,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,I’d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.
7629,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Oh, I’ll send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive."
7630,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,"Oh, I can’t believe that."
7631,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.
7632,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,My apologies. I’ve been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.
7633,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Understandable.
7634,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,Can I make you a cup of tea?
7635,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, it’s probably you."
7636,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,I feel very comfortable around you.
7637,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"I feel very comfortable around you, too."
7638,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,"It’s surprising because I generally don’t feel comfortable around, well, anyone."
7639,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Nor I.
7640,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?
7641,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math?
7642,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,I’d like to do the math.
7643,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"I’d like that, too."
7644,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Okay, now this time…"
7645,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Uh-huh.
7646,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"You’re gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime."
7647,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"I’m sorry, I didn’t hear anything after lick."
7648,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Neck, shot, lime."
7649,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Okay, shot, lime."
7650,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Right. Ah! Where’s the lime?
7651,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Oh, okay, we’re sharing."
7652,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,"So, what do you think?"
7653,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,I’m very tempted. I’m just not sure it’s appropriate with my son’s roommate.
7654,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,"Normally, I’d feel the same way. But based on everything I’ve observed about us, I can’t help but speculate we’d be very good together."
7655,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,True. I’ve had a similar observation. It’s certainly something I could never do with my husband.
7656,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,"I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It’s quite satisfying."
7657,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,I see what you’re doing. You’re appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.
7658,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Sheldon,"You see right through me, don’t you?"
7659,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Only when you’re in a CAT scanner.
7660,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,This is actually gonna happen.
7661,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush."
7662,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"You shush, I’m happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn’t get as children."
7663,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,Why would you bring that up right now?
7664,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,I don’t know. Foreplay?
7665,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"So you’re saying you’re not having sex with me, you’re having sex with your mother?"
7666,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Ummm, I’m gonna go with “no.”"
7667,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,That is the sickest thing I’ve ever heard.
7668,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Come on, you’re trying to have sex with your father, and I’m okay with that."
7669,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,Get out!
7670,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,She said shush. I should have shushed.
7671,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight."
7672,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"That’s not really in my control, is it? Oh, uh, yes"
7673,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Oh, good morning."
7674,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,Morning.
7675,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"Look, I was just coming over to talk to you."
7676,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,You don’t have to. Ever.
7677,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,Gotcha.
7678,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Leonard,"Good-bye, Mother."
7679,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Good-bye, Leonard. So, Slugger, shall we pick up where we left off last time?"
7680,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,"I mean, my mom could’ve just said, “Bob, get over it, she’s a girl, move on.” But she didn’t. Not one word."
7681,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,Interesting. Would you be willing to fly to New Jersey and discuss your relationship with your parents during a brain scan?
7682,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Penny,Would it help?
7683,2,15,the maternal capacitance,Beverley,"Well, it would help me."
7684,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,That was close.
7685,2,16,the cushion saturation,Raj,"God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning."
7686,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Yeah, still funny, Raj."
7687,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,There’s no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.
7688,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,But what about the creek bed?
7689,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"The Pharmacology Department controls that, and they’re all hopped up on experimental steroids."
7690,2,16,the cushion saturation,Raj,"Well, that’s it then, we’re doomed."
7691,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.
7692,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic."
7693,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,And I told you I wanted to see a doctor’s note.
7694,2,16,the cushion saturation,Raj,We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?
7695,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?
7696,2,16,the cushion saturation,Raj,We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.
7697,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.
7698,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"No, that shouldn’t be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They’re probably just all staring at the sky."
7699,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth’s Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us."
7700,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,Why don’t I run away and you cover me?
7701,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"Because you chose your mother’s veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!"
7702,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,I had to take her! It’s almost bathing suit weather!(Another player bursts through the door)
7703,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,I surrender! Don’t shoot! They went that way!
7704,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"Howard, I’m on your team."
7705,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Oh, Leslie, thank God."
7706,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,Where’s the rest of your squad?
7707,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Ah, they left me here to die. What about yours?"
7708,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"Dead, all of them."
7709,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,Sorry.
7710,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,Don’t be. It was friendly fire. They just wouldn’t listen.
7711,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Well, we’re surrounded, so I guess there’s nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed."
7712,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"Hmm, that’s the worst part, the waiting."
7713,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,All the while knowing that there’s a paint pellet out there with your name on it.
7714,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"Yeah, the big wet ball of death. Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn’t it?"
7715,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,It kind of does.
7716,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,I say we make every moment count.
7717,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,I agree. How exactly do we do that?
7718,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Howard, why aren’t you covering us? We’re getting slaughtered out here!"
7719,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,War is hell.
7720,2,16,the cushion saturation,Raj,Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?
7721,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Yeah, more cutbacks."
7722,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don’t simply let some of you go so that there’s money available for my research.
7723,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"You know what baffles me, Sheldon?"
7724,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine."
7725,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"Hey, guys."
7726,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Hey, Leslie."
7727,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,Hey.
7728,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"Howard, I got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted."
7729,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"That’s great, Leslie. Thanks."
7730,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Rawr."
7731,2,16,the cushion saturation,Raj,What was all that about?
7732,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money."
7733,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Yeah, okay, but what’s with the back-scratching and the meow!"
7734,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.
7735,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Thank you.
7736,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat."
7737,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Are you done?
7738,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I’m done."
7739,2,16,the cushion saturation,Raj,You know what I’m thinking? I’m thinking Howard wasn’t making a back-scratching metaphor. I’m thinking there was some actual scratching involved.
7740,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"What about it, Howard?"
7741,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Okay, I didn’t want to say anything ’cause I know you and Leslie have a little history."
7742,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,I don’t care about that.
7743,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Great, ’cause I’ve been dying to say something."
7744,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,You and Leslie?
7745,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,In the paintball shed! Twice!
7746,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,Is that why you didn’t cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?
7747,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Oh, yeah, sorry about that."
7748,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense."
7749,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I’ve ever had sex with. I mean, for free."
7750,2,16,the cushion saturation,Raj,"And plus, you got a rapid prototyper. That’s an expensive piece of equipment, dude."
7751,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.
7752,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Okay, one way to look at this is that I’m getting new equipment, and you’re not, and that’s unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I’m getting sex and you’re not, and that’s delightful."
7753,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,The whole thing froze. I don’t know what happened.
7754,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Calm down. We’ll figure it out.
7755,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,How can I calm down? I’m gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That’s three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.
7756,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"Hello, Penny."
7757,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"Hello, Sheldon."
7758,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,You’re in my spot.
7759,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,Are you planning on sitting here?
7760,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"No, I’m going to the comic book store."
7761,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,Then what difference does it make?
7762,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,What difference does it make?
7763,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Here we go.
7764,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero."
7765,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,What?
7766,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Don’t sit in his spot.
7767,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,Fine.
7768,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,Happy?
7769,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,I’m not unhappy.
7770,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle."
7771,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Okay, that should do it."
7772,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver."
7773,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,That’s a lot of shoes you ordered.
7774,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it’s really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?"
7775,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.
7776,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"Oh, no, thanks. I’m from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it’s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone."
7777,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"Boy, your heart’s racing. I must’ve really gotten you going."
7778,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Well, it’s partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia."
7779,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,Sexy.
7780,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,Can I assume that you likewise found the experience…
7781,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,Satisfactory?
7782,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"That wasn’t quite the word I was looking for, but sure, I’ll do this pass-fail."
7783,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"Hey, are you enjoying that prototyper I got you?"
7784,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Oh, it’s great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out."
7785,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,Isn’t it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?
7786,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"You know, most people don’t get that."
7787,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard’s Mother,"Howard, I’m home!"
7788,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Oh, great."
7789,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard’s Mother,Book club was cancelled! That thing on Phyllis’s neck opened up again!
7790,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"I’m busy, Ma!"
7791,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard’s Mother,Too busy to help your mother with her zipper?
7792,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Don’t come in, Ma!"
7793,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard’s Mother,Why not?
7794,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,He’s got company!
7795,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Oh, there’s the arrhythmia."
7796,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard’s Mother,Is she Jewish?
7797,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,Are you Jewish?
7798,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,No.
7799,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,Yes!
7800,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard’s Mother,"Okay, then you kids have fun! Use protection!"
7801,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,You think he’ll notice?
7802,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,There’s a chance.
7803,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"Oh, what are we gonna do?"
7804,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed."
7805,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,Why do we have to tell him I did it?
7806,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Well, we’re not gonna tell him I did it."
7807,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in."
7808,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?
7809,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"I’m sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs."
7810,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.
7811,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?"
7812,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Mm, butt print. There’s no discernible butt print."
7813,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"Oh, come on."
7814,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"There, butt print."
7815,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,It’s too small and too perfect.
7816,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,Thank you.
7817,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,You’re welcome.
7818,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,Shh! Act normal.
7819,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Sheldon! How was the comic book store?
7820,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.
7821,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It’s a little chilly."
7822,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,Koothrappali picked me up.
7823,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Isn’t that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?
7824,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,They don’t talk incessantly for no particular reason.
7825,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"No, no, friends forgive the little things."
7826,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair."
7827,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Don’t you dare, missy."
7828,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something’s wrong."
7829,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,What do you mean?
7830,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,I’m not sure. It doesn’t feel right.
7831,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"I don’t know what you’re talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that."
7832,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Why don’t you just eat in your desk chair?
7833,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,Why don’t I just eat in my desk chair?
7834,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,Here we go.
7835,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don’t eat in my desk chair and I don’t work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot."
7836,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Wackadoodle.
7837,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"You know, there’s kind of an obvious solution here."
7838,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,Get up.
7839,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,There. Problem solved.
7840,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,Nobody cares where you’re going to sit. You’re not crazy.
7841,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog’s head in its place, would that be “problem solved”?"
7842,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"If it were your head, it would be."
7843,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it’s only for a week. Can’t you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didn’t really think that through."
7844,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"You claim it’s going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner."
7845,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,Why not?
7846,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,Did you notice the sign on his counter? He’s not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.
7847,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Oh, for God’s sake, Sheldon."
7848,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? “Thanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?”"
7849,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Ooh, looks like I’m gonna have sex tonight. Hey, baby…"
7850,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,His right hand is calling him?
7851,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"No, it’s Leslie Winkle. It’s a long story."
7852,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"I’ll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu."
7853,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.
7854,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"What am I supposed to do, Leonard? There’s a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?"
7855,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,No. Not at all.
7856,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Nevertheless, I must depart. By the way, did I tell you? Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider."
7857,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,That’s not fair. You’re not even a physicist.
7858,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Okay, there are two ways of looking at this…"
7859,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Get out.
7860,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,Bye.
7861,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,You’re improving.
7862,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,Thank you. It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.
7863,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"Hey, listen. Saturday my sister’s getting married. I.. I want you to come with me. It’s black tie."
7864,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Yeah, gee, I’d really rather not."
7865,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,Why not?
7866,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"When I go to weddings, it’s to scam on chunky bridesmaids. I don’t know what I would do with a date."
7867,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"Oh, all right. I understand."
7868,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,Thanks.
7869,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"Hey, I’m really sorry about that Geneva trip."
7870,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,What about it?
7871,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"Oh, didn’t you hear? I had to reduce the number of people going, and you didn’t make the cut."
7872,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,When did that happen?
7873,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,About 12 seconds ago.
7874,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don’t go to the wedding, I can’t go to Geneva?"
7875,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"Actually, I’m trying not to say it."
7876,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Okay, I’m sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable."
7877,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,How so?
7878,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,Because it’s like you’re controlling me with new equipment and research trips.
7879,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"Well, if I weren’t controlling you with new equipment and research trips, then I’d be uncomfortable."
7880,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,How so?
7881,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"‘Cause then we’d be in, like, a real relationship with feelings and all that crap."
7882,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"So, bottom line, I’m just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy."
7883,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"No. No, not at all. You’re also arm candy. So? What do you think?"
7884,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!"
7885,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard’s Mother,Right now? What kind of sex are you having up there?
7886,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Why are you crouching there?
7887,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?
7888,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,I don’t know. Texas?
7889,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new."
7890,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new."
7891,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"From that key maker, I highly doubt it."
7892,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try."
7893,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,All right.
7894,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero."
7895,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,There’s one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.
7896,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,Sit on the damn couch.
7897,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,Nope.
7898,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"What do you mean, nope? What’s wrong with it?"
7899,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Nothing, it’s what’s wrong with him."
7900,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,It’s exactly the same…
7901,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news."
7902,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,More?
7903,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,I’m afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?
7904,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,Yes. From Szechuan Palace.
7905,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.
7906,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?
7907,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Golden Dragon.
7908,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"No. No, this isn’t right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers."
7909,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car."
7910,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"But. Oh, this changes everything."
7911,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.
7912,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,What’s real? What isn’t? How can I know?
7913,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,"You did make that up, right?"
7914,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Oh, God, I wish I had."
7915,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,Leonard?
7916,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Yeah, buddy?"
7917,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,I still don’t like this cushion.
7918,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Okay, first of all, Penny, thank you for coming."
7919,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,Thanks for the shoes.
7920,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.
7921,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,What’s the plan?
7922,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we’ll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight."
7923,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"Right, just one thing before we start."
7924,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"What is it, Sheldon?"
7925,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,What the hell?
7926,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,That was for my cushion.
7927,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,"Sheldon, Penny was our only hope."
7928,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold."
7929,2,16,the cushion saturation,Penny,Screw that.
7930,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,She can’t shoot me. She’s dead.
7931,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,He’s right. You can’t.
7932,2,16,the cushion saturation,Sheldon,"Well, if we’re going to descend into anarchy"
7933,2,16,the cushion saturation,Howard,"Okay, see you."
7934,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leonard,Where are you going?
7935,2,16,the cushion saturation,Leslie,"Surrender, then Denny’s."
7936,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"Okay, Raj, hand me the number six torque screwdriver."
7937,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Stop. We can’t do this, it’s not right."
7938,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,"Sheldon, you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town."
7939,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"But once you open the box, you’ve voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred covenant we’ve entered into with the manufacturer. He offers to stand by his equipment, and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy."
7940,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Okay, then we won’t touch the hard drive. We’ll just erase the first season of Battlestar."
7941,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,There. We’re outlaws.
7942,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Here you go, Leonard. Is this going to be big enough?"
7943,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,It’s perfect.
7944,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,For taking daffodils to your unicorn.
7945,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"It’s just for my notebooks. Thanks, Penny."
7946,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Oh, I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you."
7947,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"I understand your envy. This is a can’t-miss symposium. There are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices, the advancements in multi-threaded task completion, plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium Green’s function approach to the photoionization process in atoms."
7948,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"When I go, I usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars."
7949,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,This conference is kind of a big thing. The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot.
7950,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Oh, my God, the George Smoot?"
7951,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,You’ve heard of him?
7952,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,Of course I haven’t.
7953,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, one of the great minds of our time. His work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe."
7954,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"It’s kind of a funny name, though, Smoot."
7955,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,It’s like talking to a chimp.
7956,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Okay, now that I’ve been completely insulted, have a good flight."
7957,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Yeah, I wish."
7958,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"We’re not flying, we’re taking the train."
7959,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Oh, cool."
7960,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying, and costs almost twice as much."
7961,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Well, then why are you doing it?"
7962,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we’re taking the train."
7963,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Don’t say it like that, Leonard, say it like:  we’re taking the train!"
7964,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Hey, we’re all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?"
7965,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Oh, I always enjoy that, but I’m a little busy."
7966,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,What are you doing?
7967,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"I’m simplifying the task of packing for our trip. See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera."
7968,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Well, that does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take?"
7969,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes, and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation."
7970,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,Wow. Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.
7971,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,I don’t follow.
7972,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,I wouldn’t expect you to. I’ll see you later.
7973,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue. Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue."
7974,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,What on earth are you doing?
7975,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,"Whatever it is, I’m guessing we’re doing it wrong."
7976,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight, one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes. On this side, you’ll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation, while on your side, you’ll be treated to 350 miles of CostCos, Jiffy Lubes, and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools."
7977,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"Come on, Raj."
7978,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,What’s wrong with Jiffy Lubes?
7979,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,No.
7980,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,Why not?
7981,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,That’s over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?
7982,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Sheldon, we’ve been on this train 90 seconds, and you’ve already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up."
7983,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Here. I’m hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate."
7984,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Yeah, maybe. Meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position ’cause it’s time to land in San Francisco."
7985,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,"It’s not so bad, really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan."
7986,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"He is referring, of course, to third class on Indian Railways’ magnificent Ranakpur Express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction."
7987,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Oh, look, now he’s boring on an international scale."
7988,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,Holy crap! Look!
7989,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,Is that who I think it is?
7990,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,It can’t be. What would Summer Glau be doing riding the train?
7991,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,Maybe John Connor’s aboard and she’s protecting him from an evil Terminator.
7992,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Unlikely. That’s a television show, Leonard."
7993,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,Thank you.
7994,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., that’s Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles. No, Summer, don’t kill me! I’m pro-robot! Ahh!"
7995,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,At least he’s off the train crap.
7996,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,Whee!
7997,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"Sheldon, I owe you an apology. Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance! I’ve actually got a shot at a Terminator."
7998,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,"Oh, please.When it comes to Terminators, you’ve got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger."
7999,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"You’re overlooking something. I have 11 hours with her in a confined space. Unless she’s willing to jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz."
8000,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,My money’s on tuck and roll.
8001,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,I’m confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.
8002,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works."
8003,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,All right.
8004,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,That’s Summer Glau.
8005,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,Yes.
8006,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,That’s it.
8007,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,Hang on a sec. Why do you get first crack at her?
8008,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"Um, well, let’s see, couple reasons. One, I saw her first."
8009,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,"No, you didn’t. I did."
8010,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"Fair enough. But then let me move on to number two, unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I’m sober."
8011,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,"You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty."
8012,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"Well, you know the old saying, pasty and frail never fail."
8013,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Excuse me, but what about me? Why don’t I get a shot?"
8014,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"Fine, go ahead. Take a shot."
8015,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"You know, I’ve already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can’t score with. I think I’ll let you two take this one."
8016,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,"Sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?"
8017,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level is a theatre…"
8018,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,"Yeah-yeah, which way?"
8019,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you’re going as far as Portland.
8020,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,So aren’t you going to go talk to her?
8021,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"I will, I’m just working on my opening line."
8022,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"She’s probably heard every possible line, Howard. Why don’t you just try hello?"
8023,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"No, no, no, that always creeps girls out. I need to come up with something that’s funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature."
8024,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,You’re going to need more than 11 hours.
8025,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Oh, no."
8026,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,What’s the matter?
8027,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,I forgot my flash drive.
8028,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,So?
8029,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,So we have to go back.
8030,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, I’m going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive."
8031,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,You don’t understand. My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.
8032,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?
8033,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,It’s brilliant. He needs to read it.
8034,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,So you’ll send him an e-mail when we get back.
8035,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,Then I won’t get to see his face light up as he reads it.
8036,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,Right. Of course.
8037,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster."
8038,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Well, there’s nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails."
8039,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"You forgot your flash drive, You forgot your flash drive"
8040,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go."
8041,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,It’s hot in here. Must be Summer.
8042,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"So, where you gals headed?"
8043,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Okay, I’ve found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard. We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we’ll meet the train."
8044,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,I’ve got a better idea.
8045,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,Are you going to be sarcastic?
8046,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.  But look, Penny’s home. Why don’t we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?"
8047,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.
8048,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,So?
8049,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,The key is hidden in my room.
8050,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,So?
8051,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,Penny would have to go into my room.
8052,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,So?
8053,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,People don’t go in my room!
8054,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"I see. Well, it seems once again, you’re caught between a rock and a crazy place."
8055,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Oh, I hate when that happens."
8056,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,It’s hot in here. It must be Summer. It’s hot in here. Must be Summer. It’s hot in here. Must be Summer.
8057,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,It’s hot in here. Must be Summer.
8058,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Summer,That’s cute.
8059,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,Really? I just made it up. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?
8060,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Summer,"Oh, yeah, I loved it."
8061,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,It’s loosely based on my life.
8062,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Yeah, we’re putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theatre. Can you come? Oh, great. Do you know 98 other people that might want to come? Oh, hang on."
8063,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,Hello?
8064,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Listen carefully. I’m about to give you a set of instructions, which you must follow to the letter."
8065,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,Just a sec.
8066,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"The theatre is above a bowling alley, so it’s a little noisy, but it might be the only chance I’ll ever get to play Anne Frank. And the director is brilliant. He uses the bowling sounds as, like, Nazi artillery. Okay, great, I’ll see you then."
8067,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,Hello?
8068,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Okay, step four. Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?"
8069,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,Your dresser? Who is this?
8070,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,It’s Sheldon.
8071,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?"
8072,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,I’m not in San Francisco. I’m on a train. Were you even listening to me?
8073,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Uh, no, I was talking to my friend, but what’s up?"
8074,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"What’s up? I’ll tell you what’s up. I’m in a crisis situation, and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be…"
8075,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Give me the phone. Hi, Penny. It’s Leonard."
8076,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Hey, Leonard. What’s going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?"
8077,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"He’s calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn’t use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favour."
8078,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two, enter our apartment. Step three, enter my bedroom."
8079,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call."
8080,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"No! Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough."
8081,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,"And that bright little star peeking her head out early today, that’s Venus."
8082,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Summer,That is so cool. You really know a lot about space.
8083,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,"Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly, you were actually in space."
8084,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Summer,"You’re not one of those guys who really believe that, are you?"
8085,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,"You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. Now, him, he’s one of those geeks."
8086,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. Easement. It’s a legal right of access. Good grief. What? No, don’t put me on hold. Oh!"
8087,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"Do you believe him? Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. Put one beer in him, and he’s M. Night Charmalarmalon."
8088,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,Is that what he’s drinking? It’s not even real beer.
8089,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,What?
8090,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.
8091,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,What’s going on?
8092,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"I don’t know. Some sort of placebo effect, I guess."
8093,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"Placebo, you say. Interesting."
8094,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Yes, I’m still here. Where am I going? I’m on a train. Now, what you’ll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman’s sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. Hoberman’s Sphere. It’s a collapsible icosidodecahedron. No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock."
8095,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,"Actually, in India, the names of constellations are different. Where you have the Big Dipper, we have the Big Curry Pot."
8096,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Summer,You’re making that up.
8097,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,You got me. Now what are you going to do with me?
8098,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,Raj.
8099,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,Yes?
8100,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,Look.
8101,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,What am I looking at?
8102,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,You tell me.
8103,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Raj,Non-alcoholic bee-ee-eeuh
8104,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"Hi, I’m the small package good things come in."
8105,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Okay, I got a box, but there’s no key in here. Just letters."
8106,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,That’s the wrong box. Put it back.
8107,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?"
8108,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,Don’t read those letters!
8109,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute."
8110,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,Put down the letters!
8111,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Hey, Penny. It’s Leonard."
8112,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Hey, Leonard. How’s the train ride?"
8113,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Delightful. Listen, I don’t know what you’re doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon’s mouth."
8114,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed a line. Put him back on."
8115,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,Thank you.
8116,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,I’m back.
8117,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"What up, Moon Pie?"
8118,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!
8119,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Hey, Penny. Leonard again."
8120,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"So anyway, in the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us. And then, I picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off. I tried to stick them back on, but before I could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread. What do you think that means?"
8121,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Summer,I really don’t know.
8122,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,I’ll give you a little clue. My favourite sandwich? Salami on pumpernickel.
8123,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Summer,Is that so?
8124,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"And did you know the word “pumpernickel” comes from the German words pumper and nickel, which loosely translates to fart goblin?"
8125,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Summer,No. I didn’t.
8126,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Okay, I found the box. Now what?"
8127,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"You’re holding a Japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. First, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. Then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. You’ll hear a slight click."
8128,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,"Hang on. Sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?"
8129,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"No, it’s a novelty I ordered off the Internet. Now, did you hear the click?"
8130,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,Not yet.
8131,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Penny,There it is.
8132,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"Okay, here’s another one. If you married the famous rock guitarist Johnny Winter, you’d be Summer Winter."
8133,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Summer,Uh-huh.
8134,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"Okay, I’m going to just go for broke here and say I like you."
8135,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Summer,Yeah?
8136,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"So here’s my question, do you realistically see any conversational path that would take me from where we are right now to a place where I could ask you out and you’d say yes?"
8137,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Summer,No.
8138,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,Fair enough. I’ll leave you in peace.
8139,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Summer,Thank you.
8140,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"But before I go, would you mind if I just take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?"
8141,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Summer,Sure.
8142,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,"Okay. Great. Now, can I take one where it looks like we’re making out?"
8143,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Okay, now you’re going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because I’m nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duck’s mouth."
8144,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Hey, how’d it go?"
8145,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Howard,Terminator broke my phone.
8146,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,Excuse me.
8147,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Okay, I’ll be honest with you. I’ve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized you’re a human being; I’m a human being. I could just say to you…"
8148,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Announcer,Next stop:  Santa Barbara.
8149,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Summer,I’m sorry. This is me.
8150,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Leonard,"Hi, my name’s Leonard."
8151,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"So, I’m thinking, you won the Nobel Prize what, three years ago? So you must deal with a whole lot of what has Smoot done lately? My thought is we continue my research as a team, you know, Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical, and when we win the Nobel Prize, you’ll be back on top."
8152,2,17,the terminator decoupling,George Smoot,"With all due respect, Dr. Cooper, are you on crack?"
8153,2,17,the terminator decoupling,Sheldon,"Fine! Smoot-Cooper. Wow, what a diva."
8154,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Raj,Knight to queen’s bishop-five.
8155,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,"Oh, very nice. What’s Leonard going to do? Does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?"
8156,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Raj,"Let’s find out. Leonard, ready?"
8157,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Ready.
8158,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Raj,Go.
8159,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Damn it. I slipped.
8160,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,"Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. You’re up."
8161,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit."
8162,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Why?
8163,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,– Because it’s almost eleven o’clock.
8164,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,So?
8165,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"So, Penny has a don’t knock on my door before eleven o’clock  or I punch you in the throat rule."
8166,2,18,the work song nanocluster,All,Ah.
8167,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,"Hey, you know what’d be a great idea? We get some girls over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess."
8168,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,"Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don’t want to see naked."
8169,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,You underestimate me.
8170,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny."
8171,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
8172,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,It’s eleven am.
8173,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,I know. You’re safe.
8174,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,This package came while you were at work.
8175,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you."
8176,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,Excuse me.
8177,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,What?
8178,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,You have to sign this.
8179,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,What is it?
8180,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"When I signed for the package, I was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I’m fully indemnified and no longer liable."
8181,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Sheldon, it’s just a box of rhinestones."
8182,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Well, the contents are irrelevant. A legal bailment has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?"
8183,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what I’m doing."
8184,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee."
8185,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a business."
8186,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Obviously, not a cleaning business."
8187,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"No, I’m making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay, and in one week, I made a $156."
8188,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,Good for you. Sign here.
8189,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Sheldon, don’t you get it? If this takes off, I won’t have to be a waitress anymore."
8190,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?
8191,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,Another waitress.
8192,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,What’s her name?
8193,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,I don’t know.
8194,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,And you’re going to let her handle my food?
8195,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,Nancy. Her name is Nancy.
8196,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,I think you’re just making that up.
8197,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Sheldon, I’m sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don’t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life."
8198,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.
8199,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Fine, cheeseburger."
8200,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,Maybe I’d be better off with Nancy.
8201,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?"
8202,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,How many of these can you make a day?
8203,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,About twenty.
8204,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?
8205,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"I don’t know, like, 50 cents. I’m not sure."
8206,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"No, Of course you’re not. All right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars."
8207,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,That’s all?
8208,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,Before taxes.
8209,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Well, I don’t have to pay taxes on this stuff."
8210,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree. But, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you might be able to make this a viable business."
8211,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,And you know about that stuff?
8212,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Penny, I’m a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains."
8213,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,Who’s Radiohead?
8214,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.
8215,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?"
8216,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,Of course I could.
8217,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Sheldon, wait! Will you?"
8218,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Just to be clear here, you’re asking for my assistance."
8219,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,Yes.
8220,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?
8221,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,I understand.
8222,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,And you’re not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I’m doing so.
8223,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,Okay.
8224,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,Good. Let’s begin with the premise that everything you’ve done up to this point is wrong.
8225,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Oh, imagine that."
8226,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,Sarcasm. Good-bye.
8227,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"No, sorry. Wait! Please come back!"
8228,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,There. Done.
8229,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.
8230,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Pretty good, right?"
8231,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"That’s 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you’ll effectively be paying yourself… $5.19 a day."
8232,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,A day?
8233,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you.
8234,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,That just can’t be right.
8235,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,You’re questioning my math?
8236,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"No, sorry."
8237,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,Want me to show my work?
8238,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Oh, God, no, no. Just please tell me what to do about it."
8239,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honoré Blanc’s 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course."
8240,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Okay, you know what, if I’m not allowed to be snide, you’re not allowed to be condescending."
8241,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"That wasn’t a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now."
8242,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?"
8243,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"You’re thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isn’t one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead."
8244,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Let’s go. We’re going to miss the coming attractions.
8245,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Raj,What’s the matter?
8246,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.
8247,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Hello?
8248,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny & Sheldon together,Hello.
8249,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,"W-W-Wait, what’s going on?"
8250,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,I assume you’re referring to the sea shanty. It’s a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.
8251,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Yeah, it’s crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes."
8252,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,"Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers."
8253,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Penny’s making hair accessories. I’m helping her optimize her manufacturing process. All right, break’s over."
8254,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?
8255,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,Hot glue.
8256,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,You’re kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.
8257,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"It won’t work, the flower’s too porous."
8258,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?
8259,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,Intriguing.
8260,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,"Good question, what are you marketing and distribution channels?"
8261,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town."
8262,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. I’m thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start."
8263,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,Why not eliminate the middle man? We could install a small server farm with a static IP in her bedroom.
8264,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,She’d need some kind of industrial cooling system.
8265,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump."
8266,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Yeah, it’s a bitch."
8267,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,"Uh, I’ve seen this before."
8268,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Where?
8269,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,"It’s a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump."
8270,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,Ew.
8271,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?
8272,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,"Actually, I’m thinking about this one stripper named Vega. But sure, calcium sulphate could work."
8273,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,Let’s think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?
8274,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard & Howard,Oh!
8275,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,I’ve got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.
8276,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,Wow.
8277,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,"Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab."
8278,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Oh, great. Raj, why don’t you and Howard go get the charcoal? Leonard, why don’t you start working on some preliminary Web site designs. I’ll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process."
8279,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Well, what’s wrong with my apartment?"
8280,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,It’s not my apartment.
8281,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Wait, wait, what am I going to do?"
8282,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,"Uh, hey, it’s your business. Do whatever you want."
8283,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Oh, okay, cool. I’m going to take a nap."
8284,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,"I’m still tweaking things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the Web site. So, what do you guys think?"
8285,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,"Uh, pretty much any way I say that is going to hurt his feelings."
8286,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,"Okay, what’s wrong with it?"
8287,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,– What’s wrong with it?
8288,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Not you. I wasn’t asking you. Penny?
8289,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Uh, well, it’s a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl."
8290,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,"No, it doesn’t."
8291,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,Please. Dateline could use it to attract predators.
8292,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Penny, this is your enterprise, so it’s ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, I’d strongly recommend that we let Leonard go."
8293,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,You want to fire me?
8294,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny’s decision. Penny?
8295,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,"Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?"
8296,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,We do?
8297,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,"Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two."
8298,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,No kidding. Two?
8299,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Uh-huh. Look at the comments.
8300,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet."
8301,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,Camouflaging bald spots. That’s primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.
8302,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?
8303,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,We add Bluetooth!
8304,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.
8305,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?"
8306,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Penny, everything is better with Bluetooth."
8307,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.
8308,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,Get out! Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?
8309,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,"The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau."
8310,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men."
8311,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,And I’ll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.
8312,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,We should get to work.
8313,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? Since when do we offer a one-day rush?"
8314,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Amazon offers one-day rush.
8315,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Yeah, but they don’t have to glue the books together. How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?"
8316,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Don’t yell at me. I’m not manufacturing. I’m just Web design.
8317,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Okay, well, I’m gonna have to call them and cancel the order."
8318,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still."
8319,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,I just don’t see how see can pull this off.
8320,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?"
8321,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,"They didn’t quit. They were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans."
8322,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Alright, let me put it this way. Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3,000 for one night’s work."
8323,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,You guys get started.
8324,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,What are you doing?
8325,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,Going online to buy shoes!
8326,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Raj,"You know, if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing this, I could have stayed in India."
8327,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,"Oh, stop with the fake third world crap. Your father’s a gynaecologist, and you had a house full of servants."
8328,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Raj,We only had four servants. And two of them were children.
8329,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,How are we doing?
8330,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Raj,We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms ready to ship.
8331,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,"Oh, God, we’re never gonna finish in time. Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?"
8332,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,I believe I’m hearing some negativity on the factory floor.
8333,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,So?
8334,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Penny, the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. Any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. Observe. Hey! Less talk, more work!"
8335,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,Nicely done.
8336,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Thank you. You hear any union talk, you let me know."
8337,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Someone’s in the kitchen with Dinah…
8338,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,Someone’s in the kitchen I know-ow-ow-ow
8339,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,Someone’s in the kitchen with Dinah… Sheldon? Sheldon!
8340,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,‘Cause I sold my soul to the company store.
8341,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Honey, do you want some coffee?"
8342,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"No, I don’t drink coffee."
8343,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Come on, but if you don’t stay awake we’ll never finish in time."
8344,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, coffee’s out of the question. When I moved to California, I promised my mother that I wouldn’t start doing drugs."
8345,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Leonard, help."
8346,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,"Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make."
8347,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,I have complete faith that you will make them. Good night.
8348,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,Leonard?
8349,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,"Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail."
8350,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"You’re right, of course."
8351,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Here, this will help."
8352,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, you’re going to have to answer to my mother."
8353,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Look at Planck’s Constant. People say it’s arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, now, let’s reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that’s not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass, standing in front the Red Queen, and we’re being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, let’s call it universe prime, there’s another Sheldon, let’s call him Sheldon prime…"
8354,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,We should have let him go to bed.
8355,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Bam.
8356,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,I can’t believe we actually did it.
8357,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,"1,000 friggin’ Penny Blossoms."
8358,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"I just want you guys to know I am really grateful for your help, and for every dollar I make, I’m going to give you 20 cents."
8359,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,That’s your entire profit margin.
8360,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,Oh. Then never mind.
8361,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,I’ll print out the shipping label. Uh-oh.
8362,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,What?
8363,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,"We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance. They want another thousand Penny Blossoms."
8364,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,Really?
8365,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,One-day rush. I really need to take that off the Web site.
8366,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Okay, well. Guess we’d better get started."
8367,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,You can’t be serious.
8368,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,Come on. What about the living organism of the workforce and the American spirit and Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?
8369,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.
8370,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,"Yes, yes, I know that, okay? I’m tired, I’ve had like 18 cups of coffee. The point is, if we all just pull together, we can do this. Who’s with me?"
8371,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,"Penny, although you may find it hard to believe, we do have lives."
8372,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,Leonard?
8373,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Leonard,"Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford, New Jersey."
8374,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"Zoom, zoom, zoom! Where’s the coffee?"
8375,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Penny,We’re all out.
8376,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Sheldon,"No problem. I’ll be back before this banana hits the ground. Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!"
8377,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Raj,Yes!
8378,2,18,the work song nanocluster,Howard,"Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Lunch is just stupid."
8379,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Okay, it’s done. Look, guys, for the future, I don’t mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones."
8380,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Penny, please, we’re facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids."
8381,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s not that bad."
8382,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Not bad? It’s horrible. I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it’ll happen to you."
8383,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"So they steamed your dumplings, get over it. New topic, please."
8384,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"All right, Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today."
8385,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Not with a thousand condoms, Howard."
8386,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"So, there is a number."
8387,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?"
8388,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,Shh-shh-shh!
8389,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,What?
8390,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,The people upstairs are moving out.
8391,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,No!
8392,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,The horror!
8393,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,Why would you just say something like that?
8394,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no…"
8395,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,How else was I supposed to say it?
8396,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don’t just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while."
8397,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,The horror!
8398,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Sheldon, I’m sure it’s going to be fine."
8399,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"No, it’s not going to be fine, change is never fine. They say it is, but it’s not."
8400,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?"
8401,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"I never met them. That’s what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell."
8402,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Well, I’m sure the new people will be just as quiet."
8403,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,You can’t know that. How can you possibly know that?
8404,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"You’re right, I can’t. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now, an opera singer, the cast of stomp, yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg."
8405,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,Why are you making it worse?
8406,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"I tried making it better, he wouldn’t go for it."
8407,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"You’re right, that’s a great idea."
8408,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,What?
8409,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"I’ll take the apartment upstairs. I can finally get away from my mother, and we can all spend some more time together, if you catch my drift."
8410,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,The horror!
8411,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?"
8412,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"I’m sorry, that really is how it works."
8413,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"You’re tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?"
8414,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Raj, help me out here."
8415,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Raj,You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.
8416,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"I knew it! PS3, definitely  PS3, who would pick a mountain bike?"
8417,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"Enough with the guilt, ma, we’ll still see each other. I’ll come over every night and have dinner with you."
8418,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard’s Mother,"The hell you will! What am I running here, a fancy restaurant? Does this look like Olive Garden?"
8419,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"Okay, I get it, you’re angry. You don’t want to see your little bird leave the nest."
8420,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard’s Mother,"Little bird? You’re almost 30, fly, for god’s sake!"
8421,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"Fine, I’ll stay! You happy, crazy lady? I sure as hell hope so, because you’re ruining my life!"
8422,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Hey, Penny, it’s Leonard. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven."
8423,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,I guess I won’t be needing this.
8424,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Oh, no, the new ones, they’re here."
8425,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Stay calm, we don’t know anything about them yet. What are you doing?"
8426,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,I’m checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?
8427,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,The box says kitchen.
8428,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?
8429,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Blonde girl,Hello?
8430,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,Hello.
8431,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,Hello.
8432,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Blonde Girl,Hello.
8433,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,Hello.
8434,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,Hello.
8435,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Blonde Girl,I’m Alicia. I’m moving in upstairs.
8436,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"That is so great. Oh, I’m Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment."
8437,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,That’s nice.
8438,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Yeah, it is."
8439,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello."
8440,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,Hello.
8441,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?
8442,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,Freakishly feline?
8443,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We’ll come back to that one.
8444,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,Sheldon…
8445,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?"
8446,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,No.
8447,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,You’re making her uncomfortable.
8448,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better you’re doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?"
8449,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,What?!
8450,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,I’m trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.
8451,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,I have no immediate plans.
8452,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?"
8453,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,Pro?
8454,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,Alicia?
8455,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,Yes?
8456,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,Welcome to the building.
8457,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"Thanks so much for helping me, Leonard."
8458,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.
8459,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Oh, hey, guys."
8460,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour."
8461,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Hi.
8462,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,Hi.
8463,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,I’m helping.
8464,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,I can see.
8465,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Alicia’s non-musical, childless and pro-rug. She’s still on probation, of course, but I like her."
8466,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,Cool t-shirt.
8467,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Oh, yeah, I don’t usually dress like this. I’m going jogging."
8468,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,You don’t jog.
8469,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,I can start.
8470,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you’re out of clean clothes again."
8471,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Thank you, Sheldon."
8472,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"You’re welcome, Penny."
8473,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"Please, you look cute. I’m dressed like a slob today, too."
8474,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,I think you look fantastic.
8475,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"This one’s a player, huh?"
8476,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Oh, yeah, be careful."
8477,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,Thanks for the warning.
8478,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Okay.
8479,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,I’ll see you around.
8480,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"See ya. I’m dressed like a slob today, too."
8481,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Oh, mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I’ve been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. “It’s a trap.” You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. “It’s a trap. It’s a trap. It’s a trap.”"
8482,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,Come.
8483,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Hey.
8484,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Congratulations, I see you did your laundry."
8485,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Well, sort of."
8486,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,How does one sort of…
8487,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"I bought new clothes, okay? Is Leonard around?"
8488,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,He’s upstairs at Alicia’s.
8489,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Oh. all right, that’s cool, no biggie. He said he’d help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?"
8490,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo."
8491,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Oh, they’re all up there, huh? Hmm, typical."
8492,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"It’s axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious."
8493,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Okay, now I see the giant squid head."
8494,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again."
8495,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment, but I’m really more of a downtown loft kind of guy."
8496,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,Cool. so are you in a loft now?
8497,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"Oh, actually I’m, uh, living with a woman in Altadena. Purely platonic, she’s also my maid."
8498,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,Sounds like a sweet deal.
8499,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"I won’t lie, it’s pretty dope."
8500,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Hello?
8501,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"Oh, hey."
8502,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift."
8503,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"That is so sweet. Come on in, let’s open it."
8504,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Great.
8505,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,Nice dress.
8506,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Oh, this? I’m dressed like a slob today."
8507,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,The guys have been helping me set up my sound system. I’ve never had such good-looking technical support.
8508,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"Oh, pish-posh."
8509,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"I don’t know, it means shucks."
8510,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,Shucks means shucks. Let one go once in a while.
8511,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?"
8512,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Yeah.
8513,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Alicia is an actress, just like you."
8514,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,That is so awesome.
8515,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"Well, trying to be, but it’s so hard."
8516,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Yeah, I know, tell me about it."
8517,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"I’ve been out here three months, and all I’ve gotten is a couple of national commercials and this recurring thing on a soap."
8518,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"That’s why I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I’m holding out for the right part."
8519,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?"
8520,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"Whatever you think is best, cutie."
8521,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Well, DTS has more low end, so… okay."
8522,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, I read the best science joke on the internet. Alicia, you won’t get it, but it’s right up their alley. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he’s doing. The man says, “well, I’m a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.” The owner then says, “well, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don’t you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?” And the physicist says, “yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?”"
8523,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"It’s a little insulting, don’t you think?"
8524,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,How would I know? I’m not even sure I get it.
8525,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"Hey, Leonard? If you’re done with the DVD player, can you set up my printer?"
8526,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, I’d love to."
8527,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Uh, hey, maybe when you’re done with her printer, you could set up mine. You know, like you promised a week ago."
8528,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Yeah, I’ll get to it, don’t nag me."
8529,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Raj,Hello there
8530,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Who is it? Oh hello, Penny, it’s open, come in. Sarcasm."
8531,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Well, they’re all still up there."
8532,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"You think I can’t hear them? Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp. That’s Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one."
8533,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"I don’t even know why I care. I don’t care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that’s all I care."
8534,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"You know, Penny, there’s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains."
8535,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"What are you saying, that I’m threatened by Alicia? That I’m like the old queen of the hive and it’s just time for me to go?"
8536,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,I’m just talking about bees. They’re on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?
8537,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Bees. Aaah! I just got that physicist joke.
8538,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner."
8539,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"Yeah, what’s the occasion?"
8540,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"No, no occasion, just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps."
8541,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?"
8542,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Yes.
8543,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
8544,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Yes.
8545,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Brown rice, not white?"
8546,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Yes.
8547,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?
8548,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Yes.
8549,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?
8550,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Yes
8551,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Good. See how it’s done, Leonard?"
8552,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?"
8553,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,You want to watch Battlestar?
8554,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"What can I say? I got my geek on, boys."
8555,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"No, no, PMS is different."
8556,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"Oh, thank God you’re home. I need help."
8557,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,What’s wrong?
8558,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,I just got a callback to audition for CSI to play a hooker who gets killed.
8559,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Oh, I’d watch that."
8560,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"But my car is in the shop, and I have to be at Universal in forty-five minutes."
8561,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"Okay, well, I’ll take you."
8562,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"Oh, you’re a lifesaver."
8563,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,I’ll run lines with you in the car.
8564,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"Great. And afterward, I’ll take you all out for Chinese."
8565,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Oh, actually, that’s okay. we already have…"
8566,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,Yum. Starving.
8567,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,…chinese food right here.
8568,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"They’re gone, Penny. They can’t hear you."
8569,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"I cannot believe they’re letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle’s house in Orange County to pick up her TV?"
8570,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.
8571,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I’m telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn."
8572,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,May I interject something here?
8573,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Please.
8574,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,You got the wrong mustard.
8575,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,Hi.
8576,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,Guess what? I got the part on CSI.
8577,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Oh boy.
8578,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,Something wrong?
8579,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Uh, no. No, no, no, you know, congratulations, I think you’ll make a great hooker."
8580,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"Thank you. Hey, I got to ask you something, how much do physicists make?"
8581,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Um, I don’t know, I don’t think a lot."
8582,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"Yeah, that’s what I figured. Well, got to run, the guys promised to set up my satellite dish and paint my bedroom. Yay!"
8583,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?"
8584,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,About what?
8585,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Well, you know, it’s just that Leonard and Howard and Raj, they aren’t like other guys. They’re special."
8586,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"Okay, they’re special, and?"
8587,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Oh, let’s see, how can I explain this, um, they don’t know how to use their shields."
8588,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,Shields?
8589,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Yeah, you know, like in Star Trek, when you’re in battle and you raise the shields? Where the hell did that come from? Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so, please don’t take advantage of them."
8590,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,Who says I’m taking advantage of them?
8591,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Come on, they’re doing everything for you, because you’re leading them on."
8592,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,So I let them do stuff for me. They’re happy. I get stuff. Who cares? And how’s it any different from what you do?
8593,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Excuse me?
8594,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,I’ve seen you around them. Are you pretending like you don’t do the exact same thing?
8595,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Okay, lady, you are way out of line."
8596,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"Oh, I’m out of line?"
8597,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Yeah, you’re out of line."
8598,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Alicia,"Well, what are you going to do about it, bitch?"
8599,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Raj,"I like green lantern, I’m just saying it’s pretty lame that He can be defeated by the colour yellow."
8600,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.
8601,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.
8602,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Raj,"Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?"
8603,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"Oh, my God! Girl fight!"
8604,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,What are you doing?
8605,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,I know you. you’re stupid enough to break it up.
8606,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,May I say you look very comely tonight?
8607,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,Thank you.
8608,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"You’re right, this filly’s been broken."
8609,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"You set it on DTS, didn’t you?"
8610,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Leonard,"I had to, she called me cutie."
8611,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Howard,"According to Alicia’s facebook page, she’s hooking up with one of the producers on CSI."
8612,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Penny,"Well, dead whore on TV, live one in real life."
8613,2,19,the dead hooker juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Oh, great now she’s jumping up and down on the bed."
8614,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,Hu-u-u-uh…. Hu-u-u-uh!
8615,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,Problem?
8616,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,This is Thai food.
8617,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,Here we go.
8618,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,We don’t have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.
8619,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday."
8620,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday."
8621,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we’ve been in lately."
8622,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we’re going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let’s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra."
8623,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,I could go for some goat.
8624,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Sheldon, we agreed we’d do something different tonight."
8625,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,All right. Let’s go to the comic book store.
8626,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,We went to the comic book store last night.
8627,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, we’ll be going on Thursday, because it’s Anything Can Happen Thursday."
8628,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon."
8629,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,So what are we going to do tonight?
8630,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies’ Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots."
8631,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero."
8632,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?
8633,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?"
8634,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient."
8635,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,The Wolowitz Coefficient?
8636,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius."
8637,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,You’re joking.
8638,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"I’m a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex."
8639,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,"Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s bounce, bitches."
8640,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"You’re right. It’s Anything Can Happen Thursday, let’s hit the clubs and meet hot women!"
8641,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We’re going to hit it and quit it.
8642,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.
8643,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,Also a good plan.
8644,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we’re definitely going to a bar."
8645,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Oh, absolutely."
8646,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,"You heard that, Ladies’ Night ladies? We’re eventually coming for you!"
8647,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,Fascinating.
8648,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"Oh hey, guys, where’re you headed?"
8649,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"To the comic book store. You’re probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday."
8650,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"You got me. While you’re there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?"
8651,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.
8652,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?"
8653,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,Sure. What does he like?
8654,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"I don’t know, he’s 13. Just pick out anything."
8655,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows."
8656,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.
8657,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?"
8658,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,Leonard?
8659,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"You know this can go on all night, why don’t you just come with us?"
8660,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"Ugh, that’s what I was trying to avoid."
8661,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man."
8662,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"Oh, what a cute, little store. Everybody’s staring at me."
8663,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Don’t worry, they’re more scared of you than you are of them."
8664,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?"
8665,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,A superb choice.
8666,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"Oh, great."
8667,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse."
8668,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,What’s a multiverse?
8669,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,Get her out of here.
8670,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Come on, I’ll help you pick something."
8671,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,That’s right. She’s with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.
8672,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle."
8673,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Store clerk,"Oh, hey, Leonard. Can I help you find something?"
8674,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She’s looking for some comic books."
8675,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"Oh, really. Blink twice if you’re here against your will."
8676,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"I think we’re fine, Stuart."
8677,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,Let me know if you need anything.
8678,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.
8679,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,You mean for someone who’s into comic books?
8680,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"No, no, no, I just meant for… yeah."
8681,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn’t make them weirdos. Stuart’s a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design."
8682,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?
8683,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Ah, yeah, that’s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn’t really help the point I’m trying to make."
8684,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Let it go, Sheldon."
8685,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,Why should I let it go? I saw it first.
8686,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Yes, but I saw it from the front."
8687,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,A far less impressive feat.
8688,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection."
8689,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,I need it for my Robin collection.
8690,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
8691,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,Why would I gamble? It’s mine. Let go.
8692,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,You let go.
8693,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"No, you!"
8694,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,Problem?
8695,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Yes, he won’t let go of my comic book."
8696,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,It’s my comic book!
8697,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Leonard, we need a ruling."
8698,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Uh, cut it in half?"
8699,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,Excuse me.
8700,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,Hello again.
8701,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?
8702,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"A 13-year-old girl. But if you’re dead set on a comic book, try this."
8703,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"Oh, Hellblazer. What’s this about?"
8704,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"A morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes, has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead."
8705,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"Well, if that doesn’t make me the favourite aunt, I don’t know what will. Is this me?"
8706,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,Depends. Do you like it?
8707,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,It’s really good.
8708,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"Yes, that’s you."
8709,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"That’s so sweet, but what if I didn’t like it?"
8710,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"It’d still be you, but I’d feel like an idiot."
8711,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,I don’t believe it. Stuart’s putting the moves on Penny.
8712,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!
8713,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests."
8714,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,"Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny’s business over there?"
8715,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Nobody’s up in anybody’s business, let’s just buy our stuff and go."
8716,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"Okay, you’ve got my number, now, give me the picture."
8717,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"You drive a hard bargain, but here."
8718,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"All right. So, um, just give me a call."
8719,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?"
8720,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Look at that, that’s a dent. Thank you, Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?"
8721,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,Apparently so.
8722,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,Are you ill?
8723,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,No.
8724,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,All right. Then is it fair to say that you’re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?
8725,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,When did you pick up on that?
8726,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?"
8727,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Sure, why not?"
8728,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section."
8729,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Gee, thanks a lot."
8730,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,Would you rather I offer my personal insight?
8731,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,I don’t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny’s more interested in Stuart than me. We’re practically the same guy.
8732,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books."
8733,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"You’re right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet."
8734,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,My original point.
8735,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be."
8736,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,Who’s up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?
8737,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"Oh, hey guys."
8738,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Hey, Penny… and Stuart, hey Stuart."
8739,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"Hey, guys."
8740,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,So what are you kids up to?
8741,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that’s opening tonight."
8742,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"And you guys are going together, great…"
8743,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,It is great. Really great. Freaking awesome. What are you guys doing?
8744,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"It’s Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?"
8745,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Vintage doesn’t even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It’s the buggy beta version."
8746,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun."
8747,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"Yeah, see you guys."
8748,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"See you, Stuart."
8749,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Hey, Howard?"
8750,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,Yes.
8751,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,Take me to a bar with women.
8752,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,Really?
8753,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,Yeah.
8754,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,Okay! Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.
8755,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,Why?
8756,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Well, if I get lucky, I don’t want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs."
8757,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,Do you…?
8758,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,Let’s go.
8759,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,"May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?"
8760,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"No, he may not."
8761,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,Why?
8762,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,I’m not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.
8763,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,Fine. I’ll have a chocolate martini.
8764,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,Wrong again!
8765,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,"Come on, you know I can’t talk to women unless I’m lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali."
8766,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn’t have to because there are no women in them."
8767,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,Gotcha. I’ll have a Brandy Alexander.
8768,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo."
8769,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,Should we talk to some of these women?
8770,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"It’s way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame."
8771,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,That’s your system?
8772,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"That’s my system. Oh, and if you spot a chick with a Seeing Eye dog, she’s mine."
8773,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,Oh come on. I think it’s nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.
8774,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn’t touched all the cheese."
8775,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"Um, you know, it’s kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?"
8776,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"Oh, gee, it’s a little late for coffee, isn’t it?"
8777,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf."
8778,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?"
8779,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"Uh, yeah, I guess."
8780,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,"Sheldon, we’re a little busy here, so…"
8781,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,What are you doing?
8782,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,We’re having coffee.
8783,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,Isn’t it a little late for coffee?
8784,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,It’s okay. She thinks she has decaf.
8785,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,I’ll just go look for it.
8786,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,What’s up?
8787,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Well, I’ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help."
8788,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,Oh yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn. What’s the topic?
8789,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"I am asserting, in the event that Batman’s death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl."
8790,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"Ooh, Sheldon, I’m afraid you couldn’t be more wrong."
8791,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.
8792,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"Of course it is. It’s a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable, it’s very wrong to say it’s a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right. Batman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd."
8793,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,Has to be? Has to be? I hope you’re being deliberately provocative.
8794,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Penny,I found the decaf!
8795,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"Oh, great!"
8796,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Yeah, herbal tea for me, please."
8797,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Raj,Barkeep! Alexander me.
8798,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,How about those two?
8799,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Nah, they’re eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week."
8800,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,What about the ones in the corner?
8801,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?"
8802,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,I think Blinky’s cute.
8803,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"You got it, sir."
8804,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Wait, so we just go over there?"
8805,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my friend’s had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean, they’re laughing, we’re laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we’re millionaires."
8806,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,What else you got?
8807,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?
8808,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,No.
8809,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"I can’t sit on your lap, you don’t know the routine."
8810,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"I’m sorry, but you’re obviously stuck in a pre-Zero Hour DC universe."
8811,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’être.
8812,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"Okay, you can throw all the French around you want, it doesn’t make you right."
8813,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,Au contraire.
8814,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"Plus, you’re forgetting that the Infinite Crisis storyline restored Joe Chill to the Batman mythology."
8815,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.
8816,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"Okay, look, Sheldon, it’s late and I’ve got to get some sleep."
8817,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"So, I win."
8818,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"No, I’m tired."
8819,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"So, I win."
8820,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,Fine. You win.
8821,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"Darn tootin’, I win."
8822,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"Penny, I really had a terrific time. Penny?"
8823,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, don’t wake her. She’ll maul you like a rabid wolverine."
8824,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Stuart,"You know, I don’t think that was decaf."
8825,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Wait, is this your card or isn’t it? Trust me, this was their card."
8826,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,I thought you were good at this. You’re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.
8827,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"I do, all the time."
8828,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Well, what happened? We’ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you’ve had with a woman was when your mom called."
8829,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Wow, you’re just going to make me come out and say it, aren’t you?"
8830,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,Say what?
8831,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,You’re weighing me down. I’m a falcon who hunts better solo.
8832,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,Fine. I’ll sit here. You take flight and hunt.
8833,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Don’t be ridiculous, you can’t just tell a falcon when to hunt."
8834,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Leonard,"Actually, you can. There’s a whole sport built around it. Falconry."
8835,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,Shut up. Let’s just get Koothrappali and go.
8836,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,Lucky bastard. It’s got to be that stupid accent of his.
8837,2,20,the hofstadter isotope,Howard,"Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. Okay, I’m stumped."
8838,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"Okay, are you from Star Wars universe?"
8839,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,Yes
8840,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,Were you in the original trilogy?
8841,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,Yes
8842,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?
8843,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"God, I hope not. And no, I’m not Princess Leia."
8844,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"Oh, okay, okay, my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?"
8845,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,Yes
8846,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,Interesting. Are you a Droid?
8847,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,Yes
8848,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?
8849,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,Yes
8850,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,C3PO.
8851,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,You got it.
8852,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"That’s preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don’t get me wrong, I’m flattered, I just don’t see it."
8853,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"Leslie Winkle. You’ve reached friends with benefits. For a booty call, press one now."
8854,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"What exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?"
8855,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"No. Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted."
8856,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I can’t imagine any of that."
8857,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Alright, back to the game."
8858,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"I believe it’s my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you’re ready."
8859,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,Are you Spock?
8860,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,I don’t like this game.
8861,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"So, where were we?"
8862,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,Aren’t you leaving for your booty call?
8863,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"No, it was something else. Why does everything have to be about sex with you? Come on. Who’s turn is it?"
8864,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,We were up to you.
8865,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"Great, just start."
8866,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, let’s see. Are you from a TV series?"
8867,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,She dumped me!
8868,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"I bet he’s someone from Babylon 5, we’re never going to guess."
8869,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"What happened with Leslie, why did she dump you?"
8870,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"I don’t know. She just said Howard, momma’s a rolling stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone."
8871,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,I don’t understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having  what appears be an emotional response?
8872,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her."
8873,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"Of course I had feelings for her, I saw her naked for God’s sake!"
8874,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?"
8875,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,I don’t want to go anywhere.
8876,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"You know, I’m given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. Where  you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases."
8877,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"Is it me, or was that Sheldon’s way of saying Vegas baby!"
8878,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"I’ve never been there, have you?"
8879,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,Me? No. I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in Swingers. .
8880,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"It could be fun. I know my weekend’s wide open, now that…"
8881,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, then let’s do this, lets go to Las Vegas."
8882,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,Now? Right now?
8883,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why can’t we be right now people too. Go home, pack a bag and we’ll be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that we’ll go right now."
8884,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"What do you say, Howard?"
8885,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,I say Vegas baby!
8886,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,What are you going to tell your mother?
8887,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"Sea World, baby!"
8888,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?"
8889,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,I’d rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.
8890,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Great, we’ll bring you back a tee-shirt."
8891,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"Thank you. Hello, neighbour."
8892,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Hello, Sheldon."
8893,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,And how are you doing this fine evening?
8894,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,Great.
8895,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Good. I’m glad.
8896,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,Really? Are you drunk?
8897,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"I’m just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude."
8898,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"That’s Superman’s big ice thing, right?"
8899,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"Do you know, I’m such a good mood, I’m actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today."
8900,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Mmm, what smells so good?"
8901,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally, it’s main ingredient is Paneer, a farmer’s cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes."
8902,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Yum. Well, enjoy your big evening."
8903,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"Penny. I realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me."
8904,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Have fun, Sheldon."
8905,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"Oh, I shall."
8906,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,No!
8907,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"What’s wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice thingy?"
8908,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"Look at this, mouthwash, lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle. I love Las Vegas."
8909,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Howard, could I borrow some after shave?"
8910,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"Black case, top compartment."
8911,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,That is a lot of cologne.
8912,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"First row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly."
8913,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"That’s the spirit, Howard. Yes, we can."
8914,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Come on, let’s go."
8915,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"You guys go ahead, I just have to finish up an email."
8916,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"That’s not an email, that’s Leslie’s facebook page."
8917,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"Okay, fine, I’m checking her facebook page, look at her status update, she’s saying she dumped me, people need to know I dumped her."
8918,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,But she did dump you.
8919,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"Grow up, Raj,there’s no place for truth on the internet. Just go, I’ll catch up with you."
8920,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,Alright.
8921,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"Oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky."
8922,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, uh, if I get lucky I’ll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City, and if you get lucky, I’ll sleep on the moon."
8923,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,Sounds like a plan.
8924,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Hang on, I think the emergency key is around here somewhere."
8925,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get a bowl.
8926,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place."
8927,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,I left them in the bowl.
8928,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.
8929,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Where?
8930,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,In your apartment.
8931,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,What’s it doing in my apartment?
8932,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren’t home, and I forgot it there."
8933,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,You were in my… why would you… what are you saying?
8934,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"It’s not a big deal, I was making coffee and I ran out of milk."
8935,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,You’re the milk thief! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter.
8936,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Alright, Sheldon, let’s just calm down and we’ll call the building manager, he’ll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while you’re waiting."
8937,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?
8938,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Yeah, why not?"
8939,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"Sure, why not? And after the sun’s down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. ‘Cause today’s the day to stop making sense."
8940,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,Thanks.
8941,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"I’m telling you, Leonard, video slot machines, free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on earth."
8942,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Dude, check it out. That’s laundry for a month!"
8943,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Woman,Hi.
8944,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,Hello.
8945,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Woman,What’s your name?
8946,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.
8947,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Woman,"Hello Rajesh Ram… Hi, Rajesh, I’m Michaela."
8948,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"Hello, Michaela."
8949,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Michaela,"So, are you interested a little party?"
8950,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"Why, yes, I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it would be, if it weren’t Ramayan."
8951,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment."
8952,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"Not now, Leonard, Michaela’s inviting me to a party. You better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you."
8953,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Yeah, I really need to talk to you."
8954,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"Excuse me, I’ll be right back. Don’t go anywhere. Don’t move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that you are."
8955,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"What’s wrong with you dude, that woman was all up in my jammy."
8956,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, I’m pretty sure she is a prostitute."
8957,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,What? No. ..
8958,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party."
8959,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,Maybe I can save her.
8960,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Maybe, but I’m guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try."
8961,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"It was lovely meeting you, best of luck in your future endeavours."
8962,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Michaela,Whatever.
8963,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"Oh, I miss her already."
8964,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Oh, Howard’s losing it. Check out his latest twitters. “I’m at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless, my future is without hope.”"
8965,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,Why don’t we take him to see the Blue Man Group?
8966,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,You think that’d help?
8967,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.
8968,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"I don’t know, Howard isn’t really the family fun kind of guy."
8969,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"It’s too bad he wasn’t here for that hooker. She’s exactly his type. A hooker. You know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up."
8970,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,We’re not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.
8971,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,“I’m so lonely and horny I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.”
8972,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,Suppose it wouldn’t hurt to get an estimate.
8973,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"So, how was your day?"
8974,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really don’t have to."
8975,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"No, it’s the accepted convention. How was your day?"
8976,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different…"
8977,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, that’s not going to interest me at all, just eat."
8978,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,Hello again.
8979,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Michaela,"Oh, hi."
8980,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Yeah, hi, listen, m, if you’re not busy, well, w-we were thinking you could… well, we were wondering…"
8981,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,If you’re really a prostitute.
8982,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Michaela,You guys cops?
8983,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Together,No.
8984,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Michaela,I am a prostitute.
8985,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, great. Um… uh, the thing is, we’ve got this friend, and he’s kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up."
8986,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,With sex.
8987,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,I think she knows what I meant.
8988,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,How can she when you beat around the bush. She’s from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.
8989,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Michaela,"Don’t worry, I can take good care of your friend."
8990,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn’t know that you’re a… you know…"
8991,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,Prostitute.
8992,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Michaela,You want the girlfriend experience.
8993,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience."
8994,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"Uh, actually, if it’s not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience."
8995,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"Okay, that’s question 20, you have to guess."
8996,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Oh, God, I don’t know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?"
8997,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,How can one person be a whole movie?
8998,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Okay, I give up, can we just do something else?"
8999,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.
9000,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,What?
9001,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?
9002,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Where did that even come from, did he say we were?"
9003,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered."
9004,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"No, just mail, no benefits."
9005,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"Hmm, I see."
9006,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,Why are you asking?
9007,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"I’m curious about the whole social construct. On its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. What I’ve observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl."
9008,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Well, some people just can’t handle that kind of relationship."
9009,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Can you?
9010,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,Excuse me?
9011,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?
9012,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Sheldon, I really don’t want to talk about this with you."
9013,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?
9014,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Of course it’s making me uncomfortable, can’t you tell?"
9015,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"I really have no idea. I don’t particularly excel at reading facial expressions, body language…"
9016,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"I’m uncomfortable, Sheldon!"
9017,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"Thank you, that’s very helpful."
9018,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"Alright, where are these amazing shrimp?"
9019,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,Behold?
9020,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"Seriously, you think this is the size of a baby’s arm?"
9021,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,A little baby.
9022,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,I’m going back to the room.
9023,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Michaela,"Boy, would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket?"
9024,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"Hi there, Howard Wolowitz."
9025,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Michaela,Esther Rosenblatt.
9026,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"I don’t think the manager’s coming tonight so, here."
9027,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.
9028,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Well, it wasn’t the first suggestion that came to mind, but it’s the one I’m going with."
9029,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"I can’t sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed. And given it’s dimensions I have no intention of living out E.M. Snickering’s beloved children’s book , The Tall Man From Cornwall."
9030,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,What?
9031,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. My body fits on it, but barely upon it, there’s no room for my big Cornish head."
9032,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours."
9033,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,May I say one last thing.
9034,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,Only if it doesn’t rhyme.
9035,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Alright. Goodnight.
9036,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Michaela,Turn ons. Let me see. Reading a good book in front of the fire. Long walks on the beach. Getting freaky on the Sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger.
9037,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"Really, me too."
9038,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Michaela,"Oy gevalt, you’re hot."
9039,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,Yeah. Excuse me for a moment.
9040,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,"Hey, how’s it going."
9041,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"Cut the crap, you set this up, didn’t you?"
9042,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,Yes.
9043,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,"She’s a hooker, isn’t she."
9044,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Raj,"A prostitute, yes."
9045,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,You already gave her the money?
9046,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,Yes.
9047,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Howard,Thank you!
9048,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Penny.
9049,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,What?
9050,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,I can’t sleep. how are you going?
9051,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,Maybe that’s because your hole is still open.
9052,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,I’m homesick.
9053,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,Your home is twenty feet from here.
9054,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"Twenty feet, twenty light years, it doesn’t matter. It’s in a galaxy far, far away."
9055,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,Damn it. What do you want me to do
9056,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Sing soft kitty.
9057,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,That’s only for when you’re sick.
9058,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Homesick is a type of being sick.
9059,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Come on, do I really have to?"
9060,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,I suppose we can stay up and talk.
9061,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, um…"
9062,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Sleepy kitty.
9063,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,Sleepy ki…
9064,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,No. Start over.
9065,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
9066,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Penny.
9067,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,Yeah.
9068,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,Thank you for letting me stay here.
9069,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Penny,"Oh, you’re welcome sweetie."
9070,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"Okay, I’m sleepy now, get out."
9071,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"Oh, good, you’re finally home."
9072,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Leonard,What were you doing at Penny’s?
9073,2,21,the vegas renormalization,Sheldon,"Well, we had dinner, uh, played some games, and then I spent the night. Oh, you’ll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits."
9074,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"Smell that? That’s the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!"
9075,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"They’re on me today, boys."
9076,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,You’re paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?
9077,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"No, I’m celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System."
9078,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,"Oh, get over yourself, it’s a high-tech toilet."
9079,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go where no man has gone before."
9080,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,Is that supposed to be funny?
9081,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
9082,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I’m the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology."
9083,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,"He’s right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two."
9084,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions."
9085,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It’s mind-blowing."
9086,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"Excuse me, spoiler alert."
9087,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,I didn’t spoil anything.
9088,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"You told me it’s mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown."
9089,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,I’m sorry.
9090,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,Said the Grinch to Christmas.
9091,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"Uh, hey, Leonard, can I talk to you about something?"
9092,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Oh, sure, what’s up?"
9093,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,Remember I went out with your friend Penny a couple weeks ago?
9094,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, vaguely."
9095,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
9096,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,What about it?
9097,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"Well, uh, the thing is, the date didn’t go that well."
9098,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on."
9099,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,I can’t do that.
9100,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Why the hell not?
9101,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,‘Cause we’re going out again tomorrow.
9102,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?"
9103,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,No.
9104,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on."
9105,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"Uh, anyway, I figured this is probably my last shot with Penny and I don’t want to screw it up."
9106,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Nobody wants that.
9107,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"So, here’s my question. It’s the second date, you think she’ll be expecting things to get physical?"
9108,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?"
9109,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"Okay, so, you’ll give me a call?"
9110,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, or you call me."
9111,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,Great.
9112,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Or nobody calls anyone.
9113,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,Interesting. Penny’s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
9114,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj."
9115,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?"
9116,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,I’m listening.
9117,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,Just tell him to do everything you’ve done with her for the last two years.
9118,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,"Hey, Leonard."
9119,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Oh, hi."
9120,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,How’s it going?
9121,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Good, good. You?"
9122,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,"Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?"
9123,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Sure.
9124,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,You know your friend Stuart?
9125,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Yes.
9126,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,"Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first."
9127,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,About what?
9128,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,"Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‘Cause you know, you and me…"
9129,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"No, no that’s the past. I’m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, ’cause, well, that’s my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn’t bother me."
9130,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,"Okay, well, that’s really cool of you."
9131,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, well I wouldn’t say cool, I’d just say, that’s Leonard!"
9132,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,"Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?"
9133,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,About Stuart? Love to.
9134,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,"He’s very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?"
9135,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Well, uh, first of all, don’t underestimate the value of discomfort."
9136,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,Really?
9137,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that’s why he works in a comic book store."
9138,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Oh. It’s Stuart.
9139,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,You’re not going to answer it?
9140,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,He wants to talk about Penny. I don’t want to talk about Penny.
9141,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"You’re making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance."
9142,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Why would he call me?
9143,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"We don’t know. And if you don’t answer the phone, we can’t know."
9144,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"I’m not answering the phone, Sheldon."
9145,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"Answer the phone, Leonard."
9146,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"No! There, it went to voice mail."
9147,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,Aren’t you going to check your messages?
9148,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,No.
9149,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy."
9150,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,It must be hell inside your head.
9151,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,At times.
9152,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Guys, we have a code red."
9153,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?"
9154,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve."
9155,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,How teeny tiny?
9156,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,It’s gonna fail after about ten flushes.
9157,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,But the mission is for six months.
9158,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Yeah, see, that’s the code red. It’s kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box."
9159,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,Have you notified NASA?
9160,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,No. Are you crazy?What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there’s gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?
9161,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Well, what are you gonna do?"
9162,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"I’m gonna figure out how to fix it, then I’ll tell them."
9163,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"So, what do you need us for?"
9164,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,He can’t figure out how to fix it.
9165,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive."
9166,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,"I’m trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny."
9167,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,I agree. It’s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.
9168,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station."
9169,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,Don’t you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
9170,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Good one.
9171,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,Yeah.
9172,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Yeah, ha, it’s hilarious. Now, here’s an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine."
9173,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,You mean so it doesn’t hit the fan?
9174,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop."
9175,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,Hey Leonard.
9176,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Hey Stuart.
9177,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,You busy?
9178,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Um…
9179,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Classified, Leonard."
9180,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s a regular Manhattan Project. What’s up?"
9181,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"Well, tonight’s my date with Penny and since we haven’t been able to connect by phone…"
9182,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, I’m sorry, it’s been broken."
9183,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,Or e-mail.
9184,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, that too. Everything’s broken."
9185,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice."
9186,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial."
9187,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,Okay.
9188,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don’t make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear."
9189,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,Fear?
9190,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, like, you’re afraid that if you touch her, she’ll break."
9191,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse."
9192,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight."
9193,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"Thanks, Leonard. What is that thing anyway?"
9194,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,You don’t know what this is?
9195,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,No.
9196,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,Good. Get out.
9197,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,"Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty."
9198,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,It wasn’t bad advice. It just wasn’t particularly helpful.
9199,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"For what it’s worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry."
9200,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?"
9201,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet."
9202,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,I feel terrible.
9203,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Maybe if you were helping, you’d feel better about yourself."
9204,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart’s date with Penny.
9205,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,"Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude."
9206,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"You don’t really believe in that superstition, do you?"
9207,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,"It’s not superstition. It’s practically Newtonian. For every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It’s actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around."
9208,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,Speaking of what goes around comes around…
9209,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,"Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?"
9210,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,It won’t work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
9211,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,What if we reposition the collection tank?
9212,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,It won’t work. No way to mount it.
9213,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Okay, here’s an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?"
9214,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,That could work.
9215,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Morning.
9216,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,Morning. What’s up?
9217,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity… pasta maker. I’m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?
9218,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,"Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee."
9219,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Great. So how’d it go with Stuart last night?
9220,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,I really don’t want to talk about it.
9221,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and…"
9222,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,I said I don’t want to talk about it.
9223,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Okay… I just… I kind of…
9224,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,"Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?"
9225,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,"If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin’ latte."
9226,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Hang on, I think I’ve got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod."
9227,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,You’re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you’re building.
9228,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Sheldon, I know what I’m doing."
9229,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn’t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be."
9230,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,"Howard, wait. Why don’t you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?"
9231,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
9232,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,"That what that’s for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie."
9233,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,Where are you going?
9234,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Comic book store.
9235,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break."
9236,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,"Me, too."
9237,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space."
9238,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,Why does Leonard get to go?
9239,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"‘Cause he’s upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I’m going to kick him in his ovaries."
9240,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Thanks for understanding, Howard."
9241,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"I got your back, sister. All right, I think we’ve got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware."
9242,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,"Wow, that’s heavy."
9243,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Damn right it’s heavy, it’s my mother’s meat loaf, it’s been testing toilets for generations."
9244,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master’s degree."
9245,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one."
9246,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,Fascinating.
9247,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Raj,What do you think the problem is?
9248,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,Not enough bread crumbs.
9249,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you."
9250,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"Sure, what’s up?"
9251,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize."
9252,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"No, your advice was great."
9253,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,It was?
9254,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"Yeah, going slow really worked."
9255,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,You’re kidding. Never worked for me.
9256,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told me, I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car."
9257,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Wine? I didn’t say to give her wine.
9258,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"It doesn’t matter, that’s where it all went to hell."
9259,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once."
9260,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"No, everything was good and really hot, and I said “Oh, Penny,” and right where she was supposed to say, “Oh, Stuart,” she said… your name."
9261,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Leonard?
9262,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"That is your name, right?"
9263,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I’m sorry. That must’ve been the last thing you wanted to hear."
9264,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"Well, it beats you know I’m a dude, right? Yeah, it was pretty bad."
9265,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I’m sorry it didn’t work out."
9266,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,Not your fault.
9267,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, how about that? See you soon."
9268,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Stuart,"Yeah, sure."
9269,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Yes, sir, I understand classified. We’ll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me."
9270,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,What’s classified?
9271,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,Howard’s space toilet. I’ll tell you later.
9272,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,"Well, they’ve deployed our solution. Let’s just all hope it works."
9273,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Sheldon,"I don’t see why I have to worry. My career’s not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It’s funny, because it’s true."
9274,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,"Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?"
9275,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"I’m sorry, were you talking to me?"
9276,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,"Yeah, I said Leonard."
9277,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,"Yes, you did, didn’t you?"
9278,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Penny,What the hell is that?
9279,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,Meatloaf.
9280,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Leonard,What was it doing on the ceiling?
9281,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Howard,That’s classified.
9282,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Voice,"Houston, International Space Station. We have a little situation up here. We’d like to make an unscheduled space walk."
9283,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Houston,"ISS, Houston. Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?"
9284,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,ISS voice,"Houston, we’d all like to step outside for a few minutes."
9285,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,Houston,"ISS, I’m afraid we can’t authorize that."
9286,2,22,the classified materials turbulence,ISS voice,"Uh, Houston, this is more of an FYI call. We are basically out the door."
9287,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Oh, boy."
9288,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,What?
9289,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,I can’t comment without violating our agreement that I don’t criticize your work.
9290,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Then what was oh, boy?"
9291,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Great restraint on my part.
9292,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,There’s nothing wrong with the science here.
9293,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say science.
9294,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Okay, how’s that?"
9295,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, you’ve fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now here’s a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m."
9296,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Why?
9297,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,It doesn’t say. It must be an emergency. Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 8:20
9298,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you’ll find out what it is in the morning."
9299,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"That’s 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes, I’m effectively one of Heisenberg’s particles, I know where I am or I know how fast I’m going, but I can’t know both. Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?"
9300,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Yeah, I know the feeling."
9301,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Leonard, Leonard, Leonard."
9302,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s two o’clock in the morning."
9303,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?
9304,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Everybody?
9305,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"You, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it."
9306,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,You went to President Seibert’s house in the middle of the night?
9307,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"He didn’t respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was."
9308,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"You could have waited until morning. I know, look who I’m talking to."
9309,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?
9310,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Hardly a day goes by when I don’t think about it.
9311,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Aw, how nice. Well, a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle."
9312,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?
9313,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, “Frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.”"
9314,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Okay, well, do you want to go?"
9315,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Of course not. I’m a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because it’s indoors, but if I’m able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life."
9316,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death."
9317,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
9318,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Maybe.
9319,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"I’m on the horns of a dilemma. Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?"
9320,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Easy peasy, I’m doing it right now."
9321,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"I’m not good with cold, Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I can’t go."
9322,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Well, then don’t go."
9323,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don’t go.
9324,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"All right, then go."
9325,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Listen to you. How can I possibly go?
9326,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?"
9327,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question."
9328,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,How was it resolved?
9329,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,It wasn’t. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.
9330,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,"Just imagine. If he says yes, we’ll have an entire summer without Sheldon."
9331,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,We could play outside.
9332,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,We could sit on the left side of the couch.
9333,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,I could use the bathroom at 8
9334,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,"Our dreams are very small, aren’t they?"
9335,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively accepted…"
9336,2,23,the monopolar expedition,All,Yeah! Woo-hoo!
9337,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,…the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition.
9338,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,It’s not gonna be the same without you.
9339,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,Godspeed.
9340,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature."
9341,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,"Ooh, I don’t like where this is going."
9342,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,I would like to propose that the three of you accompany me.
9343,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,To the North Pole?
9344,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Yes.
9345,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,Is this just so we won’t touch your stuff while you’re away?
9346,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"I’ll admit that was a concern. But the fact is, I’ll need a support team. And the three of you are my first choice."
9347,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,Really?
9348,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now, I know I’m proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don’t you take a few moments to discuss it?"
9349,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,"We’re not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?"
9350,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,I’m still within earshot! You may want to wait for my door to close.
9351,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,"We’re not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?"
9352,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Hang on. Let’s talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I don’t know how we can turn it down.
9353,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,"Easy. Instead of saying, no, we don’t want to go on an NSF expedition, say, no, we don’t want to spend “three months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag.”"
9354,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,"But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program."
9355,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines."
9356,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,I could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.
9357,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,You still might get on a magazine.
9358,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,So you guys are seriously considering this?
9359,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Yes.
9360,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,And you think you can put up with Sheldon?
9361,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,"Well, I’m a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I’m reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!"
9362,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?"
9363,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,I’m in.
9364,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,"Me, too."
9365,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,"Oh, damn it. Peer pressure. Fine."
9366,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Excellent. And just an FYI, as I am the expedition’s team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased fine, sir. But don’t worry, there will be a briefing."
9367,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Penny.
9368,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,Sheldon.
9369,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,What do you want?
9370,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,I need access to the Cheesecake Factory’s walk-in freezer.
9371,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,"Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature."
9372,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.
9373,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,What?
9374,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"I don’t know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to elaborate, I’m going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali."
9375,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,You’re all going?
9376,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Yes.
9377,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,For three months?
9378,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Yes.
9379,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,Excuse me.
9380,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? The woman has the attention span of a gnat.
9381,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,"Hey, Leonard."
9382,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Hi.
9383,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,Sheldon says you’re going to the North Pole.
9384,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?"
9385,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,Yeah. I’m just a little surprised you didn’t tell me.
9386,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you."
9387,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,"Oh, hey, no, you don’t have to apologize. There’s no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised."
9388,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. Now where do we stand on the freezer?"
9389,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,Is he serious?
9390,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Actually, it would help."
9391,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,"All right, I’ll see what I can do. So, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is awesome."
9392,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Yeah.
9393,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?"
9394,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,"Just a warning, Sheldon, the freezer locks from the outside."
9395,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Did she seem upset to you?
9396,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,No. Did she seem upset to you?
9397,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,No.
9398,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Oh, good, I got it right. Are you upset?"
9399,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,A little bit.
9400,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Two for two. I’m on fire.
9401,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"I mean, I know she’s not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn’t you think she’d feel a little bad that I’m going to be gone for the whole summer?"
9402,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"That feels like a bonus question. I’m going to stop here while I’m ahead, but I’ve had a great time."
9403,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Alright, now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle."
9404,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,Where are your tools?
9405,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Right here. All right, team, open up your practice kits. As the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we’ll be using to the Cheesecake Factory, because apparently I’m “ridiculous,” I’ve provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills. Leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage Casio model 1175 calculator watch I received when I won the Earth Science medal in 3rd grade. Treat it with respect. Raj, you will be painting sideburns and a Van Dyke on a six-inch figurine of Legolas the elf. Now, remember, a Van Dyke is a goatee without a moustache. Wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children’s game, Operation. To begin with, you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars."
9406,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,For this I went to MIT.
9407,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,And begin.
9408,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,I think I swallowed some paint!
9409,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"I can’t press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh, son of a bitch!"
9410,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Adversity is to be expected. Continue.
9411,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,"Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued."
9412,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Okay, I can’t do this."
9413,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,Me either.
9414,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up."
9415,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,You heard the man. Hold him down and I’ll cut him open.
9416,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Hang on, I know I don’t possess the tools of leadership, but I don’t understand why we can’t assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside."
9417,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,I hadn’t thought of that. I guess we’re done here.
9418,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Here, drink slash eat this."
9419,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,What is it?
9420,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,It’s hot chocolate with a stick of butter.
9421,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,"Okay, why?"
9422,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight."
9423,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Sheldon, you know I can’t eat butter. I’m lactose intolerant."
9424,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Way ahead of you, that’s an “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter” stick."
9425,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,"But mummy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole."
9426,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Mrs Koothrappali,"I don’t care what the other guys are doing. If the other guys jumped in the Bay of Bengal and tried to swim to Sri Lanka, would you follow them?"
9427,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,"If you were standing behind me nagging, I might."
9428,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Dr Koothrappali,"Don’t talk back to your mother. This trip is much too dangerous, Rajesh."
9429,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,"No, it’s not. Howard, tell them."
9430,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,"Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste. I understand your concern, but if it’ll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going, and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17."
9431,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Mrs Koothrappali,"So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus?"
9432,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"That’s very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies, it’ll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear."
9433,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,"Ma, I’m putting you on speakerphone with Raj’s parents. Can you tell them that you’re okay with me going to the Arctic?"
9434,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard’s Mother,Arctic? I thought you said Arkansas!
9435,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,I didn’t say that. You never listen to me!
9436,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard’s Mother,He doesn’t tell me anything! He lives a secret life because he’s ashamed!
9437,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,"Hey, Leonard, can I talk to you for a sec?"
9438,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Sure, but let’s go out here where there’s a little less yelling and guilt. What’s up?"
9439,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,"Well, I got you a little going away present."
9440,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Oh, a blanket."
9441,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,"Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket. See, it has sleeves. Yeah!  So, you can, you know, be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff."
9442,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Oh, wow, cool."
9443,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,"Oh, I’m gonna miss you."
9444,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,See you later.
9445,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Bye.
9446,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Mrs Koothrappali,I told you no. Why don’t you believe me?
9447,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard’s Mother,"‘Cause it doesn’t make sense to me! How can it be that in the entire country of India, there isn’t one Outback Steakhouse?!"
9448,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Sheldon, Sheldon?"
9449,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"I want a cookie, Meemaw."
9450,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s me."
9451,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,But Meemaw just made cookies.
9452,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Listen, I don’t know if I can go on the expedition."
9453,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,What?
9454,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,I don’t think I can go to the North Pole.
9455,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Okay, Leonard, I know you’re concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low."
9456,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Yeah, that’s very comforting."
9457,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Comforting is a part of leadership. It’s not a part I care for, but such is my burden."
9458,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Terrific, it’s just that I don’t think Penny wants me to go."
9459,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Assuming that’s a valid reason not to go, which it isn’t, how do you know this? Did she say it?"
9460,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.
9461,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,What is it?
9462,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,It’s a blanket with sleeves.
9463,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Oh, that’s clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?"
9464,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Yes, obviously."
9465,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave."
9466,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Yes, okay, but I’m gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn’t miss me that long and she meets someone else?"
9467,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,She does have a short attention span.
9468,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"So, I can’t go."
9469,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion."
9470,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,You really think so?
9471,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, I’ve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!"
9472,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,"Oh, Leonard, what time is it?"
9473,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"It’s 7 a.m. I’m sorry it’s early, but we’re leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you."
9474,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,Okay.
9475,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,What did you mean when you said you’re going to miss me?
9476,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,"Um, I don’t know. You’ll be gone and I’ll notice."
9477,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Okay, well, um, what about this? What does this mean?"
9478,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,"Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination."
9479,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"All right, fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?"
9480,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,That wasn’t a long hug.
9481,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,It was at least five Mississippis. A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.
9482,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,"Leonard, I don’t know what to tell you. It was just a hug."
9483,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Glad we cleared that up.
9484,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,Yeah.
9485,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,I guess I’ll see you.
9486,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,"Okay, have a safe trip."
9487,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Thank you. Bye.
9488,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,"Okay, bye."
9489,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Penny,Means I wish you weren’t going.
9490,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Damn it.
9491,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,What?
9492,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,We’re out of ice.
9493,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"All right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled."
9494,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,What are you working on?
9495,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,Crossbow.
9496,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Hey, guys, can I just say something? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? This is literally the top of the world. Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see."
9497,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,He’s right.
9498,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,"Yeah, wow."
9499,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,It is remarkable.
9500,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,"So, who’s up for a movie?"
9501,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,"Good idea, what do you think? Ice Station Zebra or John Carpenter’s The Thing?"
9502,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Raj,I say double feature.
9503,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Dinner’s ready!
9504,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,What are we having?
9505,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Reconstituted Thai food.
9506,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?
9507,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Check.
9508,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Freeze-dried spicy mustard?
9509,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,Check.
9510,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,"Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?"
9511,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Leonard,"Uh, oh, sorry."
9512,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Not to worry. I hid it. Bazinga! You’re in my spot.
9513,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Howard,There’s no time for a crossbow. Find me an icicle.
9514,2,23,the monopolar expedition,Sheldon,Three months. This is gonna be great!
9515,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh, thank God we’re home."
9516,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,I can’t believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.
9517,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.
9518,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"I don’t know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half."
9519,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"Oh, hi mom. No, I told you I’d call you when I got home, I’m not home yet."
9520,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"Alright, I’m home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, I’m all but certain there’s a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldn’t say that. I’m entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I’m home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, I’m not sassing you in Eskimo talk."
9521,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,I’m going to go let Penny know we’re back.
9522,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"Mother, I have to go. Yeah, love you. Bye."
9523,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"Hello, old friend."
9524,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,Daddy’s home.
9525,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Leonard, you’re back."
9526,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Yeah, I just stopped by to say…"
9527,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Yeah, so, hi!"
9528,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,Hi!
9529,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"Dammit, I should have gone over and told her we were back."
9530,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,"Yeah, it was first come, first served."
9531,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I won’t forget your contributions."
9532,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,Great.
9533,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,Thanks.
9534,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"Of course, I can’t mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy."
9535,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,We have to tell him.
9536,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,Tell me what?
9537,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,Damn his Vulcan hearing.
9538,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"You fellows are planning a party for me, aren’t you?"
9539,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"Okay, Sheldon, sit down."
9540,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"If there’s going to be a theme, I should let you know that I don’t care for luau, toga or under the sea."
9541,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"Yeah, we’ll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole."
9542,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"If this is about the night the heat went out, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about."
9543,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,It’s not about that.
9544,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,And we agreed to never speak of it again.
9545,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.
9546,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,He’s speaking about it.
9547,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,"For me, it was a bonding moment."
9548,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?"
9549,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,I thought we were going to be gentle with him.
9550,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"That’s why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy."
9551,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D."
9552,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn’t so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was… static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off."
9553,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,"He just went colon, capital O."
9554,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,You tampered with my experiment?
9555,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,We had to.
9556,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.
9557,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,Did Leonard know about this? Leonard’s my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn’t know.
9558,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"Actually, it was his idea."
9559,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard.
9560,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,I missed you so much.
9561,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"I missed you, too."
9562,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,I couldn’t even think of anyone else while you were gone.
9563,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it’s… don’t ask."
9564,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"Leonard, Leonard, Leonard."
9565,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,Do not make a sound.
9566,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.
9567,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon."
9568,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny."
9569,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Oh, this is ridiculous. What?"
9570,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"Hello, Penny. I realize you’re currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?"
9571,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,It’s great to see you too. Come on in.
9572,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?
9573,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I don’t expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance."
9574,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Okay, can someone please tell me what’s going on here?"
9575,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"What’s going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy."
9576,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,Is that true?
9577,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,It was the only way to make him happy.
9578,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,Why did you have to make him happy?
9579,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Because when he wasn’t happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death."
9580,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
9581,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results."
9582,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and I’ve already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man’s understanding of the universe."
9583,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn’t have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, it’s no big deal."
9584,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"You’re right, Leonard, it’s not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal"
9585,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Oh, the poor thing."
9586,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Yeah, I feel terrible."
9587,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Wait, wait. Aren’t you going to go talk to him?"
9588,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"What? Uh, he’ll be fine, the guy’s a trouper, come here."
9589,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"No, you’re right, you shouldn’t talk to him. I will."
9590,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Man, I cannot catch a break."
9591,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,Hey. Do you want to talk?
9592,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didn’t even get to go to Comic-Con!
9593,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Oh, hon… Uh…"
9594,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty…"
9595,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,That’s for when I’m sick. Sad is not sick.
9596,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,Oh. Sorry. I don’t know your sad song.
9597,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,I don’t have a sad song. I’m not a child.
9598,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Well, you know, I do understand what you’re going through."
9599,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?
9600,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh, I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big ol’ slutbag."
9601,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?
9602,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Well, they’re pretty tasty."
9603,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?"
9604,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Look, Sheldon, I just don’t think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it’s like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn’t true, like saying Spock didn’t care his mom died?"
9605,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!
9606,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,I like the new look.
9607,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,Thanks. I call it the Clooney.
9608,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,"I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever. Hey, how’s Sheldon doing?"
9609,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I’d say, a little better."
9610,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny finally… you know."
9611,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,Howard…
9612,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"Personally, I don’t care, but my genitals wanted me to ask."
9613,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Well, tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business."
9614,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,He says they didn’t do it.
9615,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Sheldon, over here."
9616,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,What are you doing?
9617,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,I feel bad for the guy.
9618,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?"
9619,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated."
9620,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,Come on. We said we were sorry.
9621,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,It’s going to take more than I’m sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you’ve done to me.
9622,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Kripke,"Hey, Cooper. Wead your wetwaction e-mail. Way to destroy your weputation."
9623,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.
9624,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Kripke,That’s not twue. People have been pointing and waughing at you your whole wife.
9625,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"All right, I’ve had enough. Attention, everyone. I’ m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour."
9626,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Kripke,Off a cwiff.
9627,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,My credibility may have been damaged…
9628,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Kripke,Compwetely wecked.
9629,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"But I would like to remind you that in science, there’s no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That man’s name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein."
9630,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Kripke,"Yeah, but wesearch into Dark Energy pwoved that Einstein’s cosmowogical constant was actually wight all along, so you’re still, surpwise, surpwise, a woser."
9631,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"Oh, you think you’re so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy."
9632,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,So much for our friendship with Sheldon.
9633,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,"Well, we’ll always have the night the heat went out."
9634,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,Hi.
9635,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Hey. Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, I didn’t have a chance to give you this."
9636,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Oh, Leonard, you shouldn’t have. Oh, boy! What is it?"
9637,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,It’s a snowflake. From the North Pole.
9638,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,Are you serious?
9639,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,Uh-huh. It’ll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.
9640,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Oh, my God. That’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever said to me that I didn’t understand."
9641,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"It’s actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on…"
9642,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"Red alert, Leonard. Sheldon ran away."
9643,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Man, I can not catch a break."
9644,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"So, how do you know he ran away?"
9645,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"Well, he’s not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said, I’m running away."
9646,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Okay, well, thanks for letting me know."
9647,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Well, Leonard, aren’t you going to do something?"
9648,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Of course I’m going to do something. Uh, Howard, you check the comic book store. Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment."
9649,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh, damn it. It’s Sheldon’s mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi, Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldon went home to Texas. Yeah, no, I know he resigned. Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault. No, no, no, you, you’re right, someone needs to come talk to him. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howard, you and Raj go to Texas. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment."
9650,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Well, you’re not gonna go with them?"
9651,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and… Oh, come on, I don’t want to go to Texas!"
9652,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"Oh, right, and I do? My people already crossed a desert once, we’re done."
9653,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Trust me, you’ll be fine. See ya."
9654,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,"Well, wait a second, Leonard, come on, how can you not go? He’s your best friend."
9655,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Yeah, but I already saw him naked. Just come here."
9656,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,No. I promise I will be here when you get back. Just go help Sheldon.
9657,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,Really?
9658,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.
9659,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,Maybe you can.
9660,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,Go.
9661,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,"Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?"
9662,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,"Here you go, Shelly."
9663,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"Thanks, Mom."
9664,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,"Hold your horses, young man. Here in Texas, we pray before we eat."
9665,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"Aw, Mom."
9666,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,"This is not California, land of the heathen. Gimme. By His hand we are all…"
9667,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,Fed.
9668,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,"Give us, Lord, our daily…"
9669,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,Bread.
9670,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,Please know that we are truly…
9671,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,Grateful.
9672,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,For every cup and every…
9673,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,Plateful.
9674,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,"Amen. Now, that wasn’t so hard, was it?"
9675,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.
9676,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,Whatever. Jesus still loves you.
9677,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.
9678,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, I know how to take care of my baby. His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he’s Chinese. So, do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends?"
9679,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,They’re not my friends.
9680,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,"All right. If you recall, when you were little, we sat right here at this very spot and we talked about some of the problems you had getting along with the neighbour kids."
9681,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that’s why they hated me.
9682,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,"Oh baby, they knew very well why they hated you."
9683,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,I can’t believe you bought a red cowboy hat.
9684,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"Hello? I’m wearing a red turtleneck. Plus, it was the only boys’ large they had."
9685,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,"I’m sorry, this does not look like Texas. Where’s the tumbleweeds? Where’s the saloons?"
9686,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,Saloons?
9687,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,"Yeah, like in the movies I saw growing up in India. You know, uh, Four for Texas, Yellow Rose of Texas."
9688,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,This neighbourhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
9689,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.
9690,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.
9691,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,Will you please take that stupid hat off?
9692,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"No, I want to blend in."
9693,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Raj,To what? Toy Story?
9694,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,"Hi, boys."
9695,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"Howdy, ma’am."
9696,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,"Howdy to you, too. You got here quick."
9697,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,– We took the red-eye.
9698,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,"Well, come on in."
9699,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,Thank you kindly.
9700,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,Can I… Can I get you something to drink?
9701,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Uh, no, thank you."
9702,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,"If y’all don’t mind, I got a hankerin’ for a Lone Star beer."
9703,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,There’s no alcohol in this household. Stop talking like that and lose the hat.
9704,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,Sorry. I’ll take a diet Yoo-Hoo if you have it.
9705,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,"You’ll take a Cola.* What about you? Radge, isn’t it? Oh, you still having trouble talking to the ladies? Because, you know, at our church we have a woman who’s an amazing healer. Mostly she does, uh, crutch and wheelchair people, but I bet she’d be willing to take a shot at whatever Third World demon is running around inside of you."
9706,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Uh, if you don’t mind, Mrs. Cooper, there’s a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles, and you have no idea how much I want to be on it."
9707,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,A girl?
9708,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"Uh, yes, ma’am."
9709,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, good. I’ve been praying for you. Oh, Sheldon."
9710,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,What are they doing here?
9711,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,We came to apologize.
9712,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Howard,Again.
9713,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"And bring you home. So, why don’t you pack up your stuff and we’ll head back."
9714,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists."
9715,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,"You watch your mouth, Shelly. Everyone’s entitled to their opinion."
9716,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,"Evolution isn’t an opinion, it’s fact."
9717,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,And that is your opinion.
9718,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Sheldon,I forgive you. Let’s go home.
9719,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Mrs Cooper,Don’t tell me prayer doesn’t work.
9720,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,How about that? I finally caught a break.
9721,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,Uh-huh.
9722,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?
9723,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,Sure.
9724,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,Why does it have to get weird?
9725,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,I don’t know.
9726,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,"I mean, we were friends, and now we’re more than friends. We’re whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean, it is what it is and…"
9727,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,Leonard?
9728,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,Yeah?
9729,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Penny,It’s weird.
9730,3,1,the electric can opener fluctuation,Leonard,Totally.
9731,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"Sheldon, you’re wrong. Wolverine was not born with bone claws."
9732,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don’t you think if I were wrong, I’d know it?"
9733,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"Okay, first of all…"
9734,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,"Give it up, dude, you’re arguing with a crazy person."
9735,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
9736,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"Hey, guys."
9737,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,What are you doing here?
9738,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,What do you mean? It’s new comic book night.
9739,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,"Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night."
9740,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"There’s more to life than sex, Raj."
9741,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours”?"
9742,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,I did.
9743,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"Nothing flamed out. We don’t have to have sex every night, you know."
9744,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"You don’t have to, but it’s highly recommended."
9745,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,"Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky."
9746,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,It’s not a matter of opportunity. We’re getting to know each other. There’s a learning curve.
9747,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"What’s there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy."
9748,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.
9749,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,"Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?"
9750,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ."
9751,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine."
9752,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,"Just fine? Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine."
9753,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"I’m not saying it was bad, I’m just saying it… wasn’t great."
9754,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"Okay, when you say “it wasn’t great, do you mean for both of you? Because we can totally see it not being great for her. Am I right?"
9755,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,"Oh, yeah."
9756,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don’t know…"
9757,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,Disappointed? Let down?
9758,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?
9759,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"All I know is, it wasn’t the way I dreamed it would be."
9760,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,Sex is never the way I dream it’s gonna be.
9761,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,That’s because in your dreams you’re a horse from the waist down.
9762,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Excuse me, Wolverine:  Origin. Miniseries issue two, page 22. Retractable bone claws. If you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we’d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments."
9763,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"Sheldon, dinner’s here."
9764,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Tandoori Palace?
9765,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"No, we went somewhere new."
9766,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"You’re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren’t you?"
9767,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"No, look, Mumbai Palace."
9768,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.
9769,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"Trust me, this will be just fine."
9770,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,You are the authority on just fine.
9771,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,What’s that supposed to mean?
9772,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"Yeah, exactly. Not bad, but not great."
9773,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,What are they talking about?
9774,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,I don’t know
9775,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,I know. As I’m sure you’re aware…
9776,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
9777,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"If that’s Morse code, that’s terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed."
9778,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"Okay, yeah, well, I’m just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside."
9779,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?"
9780,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.
9781,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,"Yeah, you…"
9782,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"Uh, no, no, no, don’t tell him, let’s see if he can figure it out."
9783,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"Ugh, I am so embarrassed!"
9784,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,Please don’t be mad.
9785,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,What did you tell them?
9786,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"Nothing bad, just that last night was fine."
9787,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,Fine? You said it was fine?
9788,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you’ve really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?"
9789,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,It was… okay.
9790,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,Okay?
9791,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. All right, look, let’s not overreact, you know? For a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other’s rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes."
9792,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"So, you’ve been through this before?"
9793,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,No.
9794,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,Okay-dokay.
9795,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"You know, I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?"
9796,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,So much.
9797,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"Okay. See, we should’ve done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off."
9798,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid."
9799,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"Don’t talk, just drink."
9800,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"No, you’re misunderstanding. A shiksa goddess isn’t an actual goddess and we don’t pray to them, we prey on them."
9801,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,"Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonard’s got one and you don’t."
9802,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny’s sex life in front of Leonard and Penny.
9803,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Oh, good! Now I can eat."
9804,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,What’s that?
9805,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,Sounds like a cricket.
9806,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket."
9807,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"Oh, give me a frickin’ break. How could you possibly know that?"
9808,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets."
9809,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?
9810,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I’ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ’06."
9811,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but you’re wrong about the cricket."
9812,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Howard, don’t embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play."
9813,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"No, no, not this time. I know insects, my friend, I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. In Latin."
9814,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,"Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess."
9815,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.
9816,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"Okay, okay, tell you what. I am willing to bet anything that’s an ordinary field cricket."
9817,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,I can’t take your money.
9818,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"What’s the matter, you chicken?"
9819,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"I’ve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour’s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house."
9820,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,Chickens can’t climb trees
9821,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Thank God.
9822,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I don’t buy. Bet me."
9823,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Fair enough. What stake do you propose?
9824,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue."
9825,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"All right, you have a wager."
9826,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,Hmm.
9827,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,"Great. Now how are you going to settle it, hmm? There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it."
9828,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.
9829,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,More wine?
9830,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,Hit me.
9831,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,I don’t see anything.
9832,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,Shh!
9833,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,Hallway.
9834,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,One at a time.
9835,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,What was that?
9836,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,"My stomach. Indian food doesn’t agree with me. Ironic, isn’t it?"
9837,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,Shh! Elevator shaft.
9838,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Help me open it.
9839,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,Are you crazy? We can’t go down an empty elevator shaft.
9840,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Fine, if you don’t want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I’ll take possession of your Fantastic Four."
9841,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,Let’s open her up.
9842,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?
9843,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"Don’t push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it."
9844,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?"
9845,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,"Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken."
9846,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,What are we drinking now?
9847,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,Peppermint schnapps.
9848,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
9849,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"Because I like peppermint, and it’s fun to say schnapps. Hey, Leonard?"
9850,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,What?
9851,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,Schnapps.
9852,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"Schnapps. You’re right, that is fun."
9853,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,Be careful.
9854,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful."
9855,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,Stairwell.
9856,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It’s really dark down here."
9857,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"Oh, sweetie. You really can’t hold your liquor, can you?"
9858,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"I’m okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I’m gonna rock your world."
9859,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,Are you okay?
9860,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,"Ugh, Toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?"
9861,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,His name isn’t Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
9862,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,What would you name him?
9863,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy."
9864,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingast’s Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose."
9865,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Hang on. Voilà, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I’ll suck nothing. Of course I’m joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo."
9866,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"That is not Toby, this is Toby. Raj, what do you think?"
9867,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,"Oh, I really don’t care anymore"
9868,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"God, I had the most horrible night."
9869,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,What happened?
9870,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
9871,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,Shiksa. Shik-sa.
9872,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasn’t spoken for long."
9873,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is, you’re wrong again."
9874,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,We haven’t established that I’m wrong once.
9875,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"All right. Tell you what, let’s go down to the Entomology Department and let Professor"
9876,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,Crawley tell us what kind of cricket Toby is.
9877,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"He’s a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy."
9878,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.
9879,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,Holy crap. It’s like Silence of the Lambs down here.
9880,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,Don’t do that!
9881,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,You’re such a girl. They’re just bugs.
9882,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,"Yeah, well, I don’t like bugs, okay? They freak me out."
9883,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Interesting. You’re afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You’re welcome
9884,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Prof Crawley,Don’t knock. Just walk in. Why be polite to the world’s leading expert on the dung beetle?
9885,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?"
9886,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Prof Crawley,Who wants to know?
9887,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,I’m Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.
9888,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Prof Crawley,"Couldn’t wait, huh?"
9889,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,I’m sorry?
9890,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Prof Crawley,"I haven’t even packed yet, and you’re already measuring my lab for one of your godless laser machines."
9891,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"No, you don’t understand. We just want to ask you a question."
9892,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Prof Crawley,"Let me ask you one first. What’s a world renowned entomologist with a doctorate and 20 years of experience to do with his life when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh?"
9893,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?
9894,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Prof Crawley,What’s your deal? Are they planning to outsource my job to Bangalore?
9895,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,I’m from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist.
9896,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"No, no. We’re here, let’s settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?"
9897,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Prof Crawley,Of course I can. I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet. Not that that’s going to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in Oxnard. And we’re not talking Oxnard at the beach. No! We’re talking Oxnard in the onion fields.
9898,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,"Well, could you look at Toby?"
9899,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Prof Crawley,Toby? What a stupid name for a cricket.
9900,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Told you.
9901,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Prof Crawley,It’s a field cricket.
9902,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Howard,Yes!
9903,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?"
9904,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Prof Crawley,"Young man, I’ve been studying insects since I was eight years old. You know what they used to call me in school? Creepy Crawley."
9905,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential."
9906,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Prof Crawley,"Let me show you something. See that? That’s a Crawley’s dung beetle. I discovered it after spending six months slogging through a Bornean rain forest, while my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans! So, when I tell you that that’s a common field cricket, you can take that to the damn bank! Cause God knows I can’t. That tramp took me for everything!"
9907,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations."
9908,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Raj,Enjoy Oxnard. I’m sure your daughter’s looking forward to having you.
9909,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"Oh, hey, Sheldon. What you got there? A new comic book?"
9910,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.
9911,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,What do you have a safe deposit box for?
9912,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
9913,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"What, do they have Wii cricket now? That can’t be very popular."
9914,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Penny, I’d rather not talk about it."
9915,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’m not feeling so hot either."
9916,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Why would that make me feel better?
9917,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"I don’t know, empathy? Anyway, I’m just saying that you’re feeling upset about something with Howard, and I’m upset about something with Leonard."
9918,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That’s an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley’s chicken."
9919,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,What’s Mrs. Riley’s chicken?
9920,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.
9921,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"Okay, forget the chicken."
9922,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Well, I wish I could."
9923,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard."
9924,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Of course I’m right What are the odds I’d be wrong twice in one week?
9925,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends."
9926,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.
9927,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Hello.
9928,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,Hey. What’s going on?
9929,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Oh, you’d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz."
9930,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?
9931,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz."
9932,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"Right, right. You’re saying you talked to Penny?"
9933,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Yes.
9934,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,Interesting.
9935,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Hardly.
9936,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,Excuse me.
9937,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,Have I crossed some sort of line again?
9938,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,Little bit.
9939,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Sheldon,"Hmm. Oh, who cares?"
9940,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"Oh, hey."
9941,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?"
9942,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.
9943,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,Is that what you want?
9944,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"I don’t know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends."
9945,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,I guess.
9946,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,It would take the pressure off.
9947,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"It would, wouldn’t it?"
9948,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,"So, we’ll just be friends."
9949,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,"Good, good."
9950,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Penny,Come here.
9951,3,2,the jiminy conjecture,Leonard,Okay-dokay
9952,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me."
9953,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,No.
9954,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,Why not?
9955,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing."
9956,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,Are you fun in any of them?
9957,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,The math would suggest that in a few I’m a clown made of candy. But I don’t dance.
9958,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"All right, want some French toast?"
9959,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,It’s Oatmeal Day.
9960,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal."
9961,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?"
9962,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,Morning.
9963,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast."
9964,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,Sorry. I haven’t given her your schedule yet.
9965,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"It’s an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you’d have your conjugal visits in her apartment."
9966,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"We did, but there were extenuating circumstances."
9967,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?
9968,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"No, her bed kind of… broke."
9969,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"That doesn’t seem likely. Her bed’s of sturdy construction. Even the addition of a second normal size human being wouldn’t cause a structural failure, much less a homunculus such as yourself."
9970,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,A homunculus?
9971,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,Perfectly formed miniature human being.
9972,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Oh, you’re my little homunculus."
9973,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,Don’t do that.
9974,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?"
9975,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,I want oatmeal.
9976,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn’t a giant pain in the ass."
9977,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"I’m sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal."
9978,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"You know what, I give up. He’s impossible."
9979,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"I can’t be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, “I give up, he’s improbable.”"
9980,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny."
9981,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible."
9982,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"I’m just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
9983,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,You can catch even more flies with manure. What’s your point?
9984,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,It’s a…
9985,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"Boy, that does smell good. Too bad it’s Monday."
9986,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband’s name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband’s name is Kim."
9987,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,Wow!
9988,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,I know. What are the odds?
9989,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at…"
9990,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"Sheldon! it’s an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?"
9991,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"I’m sorry. Ooh, Penny, it’s as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches."
9992,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Ooh, Sheldon, it’s as if you don’t think I’ll punch you."
9993,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"Come on, you guys, let it go."
9994,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Fine, whatever. Are you finished?"
9995,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate"
9996,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Um, yeah, sure, thanks."
9997,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,What was that?
9998,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.
9999,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"It does. But in my experience, you don’t."
10000,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy."
10001,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, now that’s you, obnoxious and insufferable."
10002,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"What’s going on, day dwellers?"
10003,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal don’t ask, don’t tell?"
10004,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,No. Raj and I are going a goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people. Anybody want to come along?
10005,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Oh, wow, you’re actually going out like that?"
10006,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"No, no. I’m going out like this."
10007,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"Howard, what did you do?"
10008,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"They’re called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery."
10009,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"You know, I’ve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub."
10010,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,Really?
10011,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?"
10012,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Okay, how about you two? Look, I’ve got some extra tat sleeves."
10013,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,Why are you carrying extras?
10014,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Well, In case I snag one on someone’s nipple ring."
10015,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Uh, yeah, I think we’ll pass."
10016,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?"
10017,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"In this case, you bet she is."
10018,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Yes, she’s pushy and yes, he’s whipped, but that’s not the expression. Come on, I want to stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner."
10019,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,They’re gonna get beaten up at that club.
10020,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"They’re gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot."
10021,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,Did you? I didn’t notice. Have a chocolate.
10022,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,Thank you.
10023,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,I think we’re fitting in quite nicely.
10024,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,It’d help if you weren’t drinking light beer.
10025,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"Oh, what’s so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?"
10026,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Hello, it looks like blood. Did you even read the Wiki How link I sent you on being goth?"
10027,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"No, I’m behind on my wiki-reading I’m kind of on a John Grisham kick right now."
10028,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,What?
10029,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"Well, I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much, I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining."
10030,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night."
10031,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it. Can you pass the Chex mix, please. Thank you. We are lost boys."
10032,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Girl,Good for you.
10033,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,I’m actually much morelost than he is.
10034,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Girl,Nice ink.
10035,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,Thanks. Can we buy you ladies a drink?
10036,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Girl,Two light beers.
10037,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"Light beers? Well, Wiki-how about that?"
10038,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Second girl,What’s your names?
10039,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,I’m Howard.
10040,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,Raj.
10041,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Girl,I’m Bethany.
10042,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Nice to meet you, Bethany."
10043,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"Yes, very nice."
10044,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Bethany,Nice to meet you too.
10045,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Second girl,I’m Sarah. Not that anyone cares.
10046,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?
10047,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,What’s this cartoon called again?
10048,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,Oshikuru Demon Samurai.
10049,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"And it’s not a cartoon, it’s anime."
10050,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three."
10051,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,You’re here a lot now.
10052,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Oh, am I talking too much? I’m sorry. Zip."
10053,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,Thank you. Chocolate?
10054,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,Yes please.
10055,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Oh. Hey, Kim. Yeah, I…"
10056,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"You know what, hold on, let me take this in the hall."
10057,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,You’ll never guess who they got to replace you at work…
10058,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"Okay, I know what you’re doing."
10059,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,Really?
10060,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"Yes, you’re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour."
10061,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,Very good. Chocolate?
10062,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"No, I don’t want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can’t train my girlfriend like a lab rat."
10063,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"Actually, it turns out I can."
10064,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"Well, you shouldn’t."
10065,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"There’s just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren’t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose."
10066,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"No, this has to stop now."
10067,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"I’m not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the “bazinga” was implied. I’m just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will."
10068,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"No, you’re not sanding Penny."
10069,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"Are you saying that I’m forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?"
10070,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"Yes, you’re forbidden."
10071,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,Bad Leonard.
10072,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Bethany,So what do you guys do?
10073,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music."
10074,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,Goth food.
10075,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sarah,What’s goth food?
10076,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,Uh… blackened salmon?
10077,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Bethany,"No, I meant what do you do for jobs?"
10078,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"Oh, we’re scientists."
10079,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Yeah, you know, the dark sciences."
10080,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Bethany,What are the dark sciences
10081,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"Well, I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about."
10082,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,Oy vay.
10083,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,That sounds really cool.
10084,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Does it? Okay, if you like space stuff, I design components for the international space station. Which is in space. Where, as I’m sure you know, no one can hear you scream."
10085,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,So what do you gals do?
10086,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Bethany,I work at the Gap.
10087,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,Really? How about that? I’ve been to the Gap.
10088,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"Yeah, I’ve been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket."
10089,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sarah,"I work there too. Not that anyone cares. You know, this place is boring."
10090,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Bethany,Yeah. Why don’t we go somewhere else and have some fun?
10091,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,Okay.
10092,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"Sure, we like fun."
10093,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,We are fun people.
10094,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,Dark and fun.
10095,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Bethany,"Come on, I know a place you’ll really dig."
10096,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,Did you bring the black condoms?
10097,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,In my fanny pack.
10098,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,Let’s go.
10099,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,Are you happy now?
10100,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,Not particularly.
10101,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Oh’ my God, she didn’t!"
10102,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,What could she possibly be talking about for so long?
10103,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week."
10104,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,No.
10105,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed."
10106,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,You’re not squirting her in the face with water.
10107,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"No, of course not. We’re talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever."
10108,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,Forget it.
10109,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"Oh, come on, you can’t tell me that you’re not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend."
10110,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"I’m not. And Penny’s qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is."
10111,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?"
10112,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,Yes.
10113,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,You wouldn’t prefer a throaty chuckle?
10114,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,You’re not changing how Penny laughs.
10115,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register."
10116,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Uh, sorry guys, that girl is freaky!"
10117,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,Come again?
10118,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,Freaky.
10119,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,Freaky?
10120,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Yeah, freaky."
10121,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,Have a chocolate.
10122,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,Thank you.
10123,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?
10124,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Uh, yeah!"
10125,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,What is your mother going to say?
10126,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,She’s not going to see it. She takes my temperature orally now.
10127,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Bethany,"What are you going to get, Howard?"
10128,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Well, I can’t really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull or Kermit the Frog."
10129,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Bethany,Kermit the Frog?
10130,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,You know
10131,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Hi ho, I’m on Howard’s butt!"
10132,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Bethany,"Get the mean little skull, and I’ll see if I can make him smile."
10133,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Yeah, I’d like the mean little skull, please."
10134,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sarah,"What are you going to get, Raj?"
10135,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"With my luck, hepatitis"
10136,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Tattooist,"Okay, here we go."
10137,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
10138,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Tattooist,That’s just rubbing alcohol.
10139,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"I know, but it was cold. Ow, ow, ow!"
10140,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Tattooist,I’m putting on the stencil.
10141,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,What comes after the stencil?
10142,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Tattooist,This.
10143,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Aaaaaargh! Okay, that’s it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo."
10144,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Bethany,"What’s the big deal, you’ve done this before."
10145,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"No, I haven’t, look."
10146,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"I’m sorry, I’m a fraud, he’s a fraud."
10147,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,We’re both frauds.
10148,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Yeah, I think I covered that."
10149,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,But I was summing up.
10150,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"We’re not goth, we’re just guys."
10151,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"Very, very smart guys."
10152,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Bethany,So you were totally scamming us?
10153,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,Yes. And I wouldn’t blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. Unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.
10154,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Bethany,I’m leaving.
10155,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sarah,I’m leaving too. Not that anyone cares.
10156,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"When we tell this story, let’s end it differently."
10157,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?
10158,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,"Well, I’m going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, you’ll keep the decibel level to a minimum."
10159,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,Of course.
10160,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,Thank you.
10161,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Mmm, these are so good"
10162,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,Unbelievable.
10163,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,What?
10164,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too."
10165,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place."
10166,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,"Really, that’s a lot of work, and it’s kind of late."
10167,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Penny,"Yeah, but if we stay there, we won’t have to be quiet."
10168,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Leonard,Let’s go.
10169,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Sheldon,Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.
10170,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Okay, wait, how about this? We say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends."
10171,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?"
10172,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,What’s that got to do with the story?
10173,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.
10174,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Fine, they smelled good."
10175,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle."
10176,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,Whatever.
10177,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us."
10178,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"No, no. Look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we’ll pick."
10179,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,I’m sorry. Go on.
10180,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Okay. We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place."
10181,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,But we don’t have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?
10182,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,We say they’re in a very intimate area.
10183,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"Oh, we are bad boys, aren’t we?"
10184,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub."
10185,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,But we just got tattoos. Wouldn’t we be concerned about bacterial infection?
10186,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"True. Okay, forget the hot tub. The point is, we each have a ménage with sexy goth girls."
10187,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,Wow. What a great night.
10188,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,"Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night."
10189,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,"Yeah, maybe we’ll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls."
10190,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Howard,Could happen.
10191,3,3,the gothowitz deviation,Raj,I wonder how they smell.
10192,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,This movie baffles me every time we watch it.
10193,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,What do you mean?
10194,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Well, the instructions are very clear, don’t feed the gremlins after midnight, don’t get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?"
10195,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"Hi, guys. Hi, honey."
10196,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,Hey.
10197,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Ooh, we’re honey now, are we?"
10198,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult."
10199,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,You’re boring people sweetie.
10200,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely."
10201,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"So, what are you guys doing?"
10202,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,Celebrating Columbus Day.
10203,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,"We’re watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus."
10204,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?
10205,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,The parade.
10206,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they’re calling it off on account of my brother’s trial."
10207,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,What’s he on trial for?
10208,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you’d actually like my brother, he’s kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I’d have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited."
10209,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,Oh. I’ll be there.
10210,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?
10211,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,I guess I could serve both.
10212,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,You guess? You don’t seem to have much of a handle on this.
10213,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil."
10214,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,Tur-briska-fil?
10215,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It’s not as good as it sounds.
10216,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"Raj, what about you?"
10217,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal?"
10218,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"All right, this year, you don’t have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I don’t even chew it. I swallow it like pills."
10219,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,"So, what’s going on with Raj?"
10220,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother’s tur-brka-fil."
10221,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"Hard to believe, but go on."
10222,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"The bad news is, he says he’s getting deported."
10223,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,"What do you mean, he’s getting deported?"
10224,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I’d choose pirate."
10225,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?"
10226,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues."
10227,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that’s an all-male profession."
10228,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Okay, she’s gone."
10229,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Sorry. I lost my cool.
10230,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,"So, what’s going on?"
10231,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Okay, here’s the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end."
10232,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,So?
10233,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"So, my visa’s only good as long as I’m employed at the university, and when they find out I’ve got squat, they’re going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat."
10234,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,"So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?"
10235,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?"
10236,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,And you’ve continued to take the university’s money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.
10237,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"I don’t want to go back to India. It’s hot and loud, and there’s so many people. You have no idea, they’re everywhere."
10238,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Okay, guys, think, how do we keep Raj in the country?"
10239,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,Why doesn’t he just get another job?
10240,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,What are you asking me for? I don’t know if you can talk now or not.
10241,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Oh, beef, I’m going to miss you so much. Do you know, at the Mumbai McDonald’s, you can’t get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce, curry, which, in India, believe you me, is really not that special."
10242,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,"Don’t worry, you’ll find another job."
10243,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?”
10244,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj."
10245,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Hello Sheldon.
10246,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Forgive me, as you know, I’m no adept at reading facial cues, but I’m going to take a stab here, you’re either sad or nauseated."
10247,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,I’m sad.
10248,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,I was going to say sad. I don’t know why I hedged.
10249,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,What are you eating?
10250,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.
10251,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Oh, beefaroni. I think I’ll miss you most of all."
10252,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,I’ve always been a little confused about this. Why don’t Hindus eat beef?
10253,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,We believe cows are gods.
10254,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God."
10255,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I’m in, I’ll take you out, I swear to cow!"
10256,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,I’m sorry.
10257,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Me, too. I’m just, I’m a little on edge."
10258,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best."
10259,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Thank you.
10260,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,And you’re wrong about Hinduism and cows.
10261,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team."
10262,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"You, you’re kidding. That’s fantastic!"
10263,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview."
10264,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,I’m on it.
10265,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"That’s happy, right?"
10266,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,Yeah.
10267,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Nailed it.
10268,3,4,the pirate solution,Prof Laughlin,"Dr. Koothrappali, come on in. I was surprised to hear you were interested In joining our little team. Giving up on those trans-Neptunian objects, are we?"
10269,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"No, no, it’s a very promising area. In a perfect world I’d spend several more years on it. But I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis."
10270,3,4,the pirate solution,Prof Laughlin,"Splendid. Uh, please sit down. Can I offer you a sherry?"
10271,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"It’s a little early, isn’t it?"
10272,3,4,the pirate solution,Prof Laughlin,Not on Proxima Centauri.
10273,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"That’s very good. Jolly amusing, but if you don’t mind, I’ll hold off until sunset on titan."
10274,3,4,the pirate solution,Prof Laughlin,"Oh, well done. I have a feeling you’re going to fit in just fine, Dr. Koothrappali."
10275,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Thank you, sir."
10276,3,4,the pirate solution,Woman,I’m sorry. Am I late?
10277,3,4,the pirate solution,Prof Laughlin,"No, no, no. Right on time. Dr. Koothrappali, may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT. She’ll be heading up our data analysis team."
10278,3,4,the pirate solution,Dr Millstone,"It’s nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali. I read your paper on Kuiper belt object size distribution. I really enjoyed it. How did you correct for the selection bias?"
10279,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency."
10280,3,4,the pirate solution,Dr Millstone,That’s just fascinating.
10281,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?"
10282,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,What do you mean you didn’t get the job? How could you not get it?
10283,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"You know, he’s British, I’m Indian, ever since Gandhi they haven’t liked us very much."
10284,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,"Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint."
10285,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"That’s okay. A complaint has been filed. So, that’s it. That was my last hope. I’m going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or, as you may know him, Dave from AT&T customer service."
10286,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,I’m really going to miss you.
10287,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Will you come visit me in India?
10288,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Gee, that’s, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?"
10289,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.
10290,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Tell you what, we’ll skype."
10291,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Gentlemen.
10292,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,Hey.
10293,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?"
10294,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,No.
10295,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, he’s met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit…"
10296,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,"Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?"
10297,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, if you didn’t cheer at my entrance, it’s too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me."
10298,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,You want me to work with you?
10299,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,For me. You’re going to have to listen more carefully when you’re on the job.
10300,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Okay, uh, please don’t take this the wrong way, but I’d rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you."
10301,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,For me.
10302,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Sheldon, are you busy?"
10303,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Of course I’m busy.
10304,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Shall I wait?
10305,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Yes, please."
10306,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,How may I help you?
10307,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,I’ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.
10308,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,For me.
10309,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture."
10310,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"I’m impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions."
10311,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Thank you.
10312,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,I reject them all.
10313,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.
10314,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I believe you’ve misunderstood. I’m not giving you the job. I’m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we’ll get started with the interview."
10315,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Wha… You’re kidding!
10316,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Please.
10317,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,All right.
10318,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"So, that’s what you wear to an interview?"
10319,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Come on, dude, we’ve been friends for years."
10320,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Oh, pulling strings, are we?"
10321,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Sheldon, for God’s sakes, don’t make me beg."
10322,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Bazinga! You’ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I’m your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.
10323,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"Ah, it’s nice having the place to ourselves, isn’t it?"
10324,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,"Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don’t have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy."
10325,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?"
10326,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,What are you thinking?
10327,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,Let’s slide over to Sheldon’s spot a make out.
10328,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,You are a dirty girl.
10329,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"Oh, God, how did he know?"
10330,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,Hello.
10331,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,"Hi, Howard."
10332,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,Am I interrupting?
10333,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,"Little bit, yeah."
10334,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,Guess I should have called.
10335,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"Yeah, maybe."
10336,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,Tonight’s the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the palomino.
10337,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,Uh-huh.
10338,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,But he’s working with Sheldon.
10339,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"Yes, we know."
10340,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,Want me to leave?
10341,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,"You know, whatever."
10342,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city."
10343,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,Yikes.
10344,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"Hey, I happen to love this movie."
10345,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Fine, let’s watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize."
10346,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"All right, we’re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space."
10347,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke."
10348,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,I’m the boss. I make the jokes.
10349,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Sorry, go ahead and make your joke."
10350,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"This is not the time for joking. We’re doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus."
10351,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"All right, let’s buckle down and work."
10352,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Sheldon.
10353,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,What?
10354,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,I need an aspirin.
10355,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Top desk drawer.
10356,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Thank you.
10357,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Alright?
10358,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Yes.
10359,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Good.
10360,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,That was fun. Thank you.
10361,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"Leonard, honey, you don’t have to say thank you every time we have sex."
10362,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you’re going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.
10363,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,Top o’ the mornin’o ya!
10364,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,What are you doing here?
10365,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he’s still working with Sheldon, so I thought I’d come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It’s the perfect meal for apres l’amour."
10366,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"Oh, kill me."
10367,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"By the way, I couldn’t help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard."
10368,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn’t have had to hear that."
10369,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"What do you guys think? Want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?"
10370,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,Do something.
10371,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,"Yeah, okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk."
10372,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Sure. ‘sup, homes?"
10373,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,"Uh, please understand that it’s not that we don’t want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time."
10374,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Oh. I get it, I’m the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. I’ll get out of your way. Uh, you’re gonna want to eat those eggs while they’re still hot."
10375,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,"Thank you. There’s lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up."
10376,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,That’s great.
10377,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,Ill just hang out with my mom. That’s always fun.
10378,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,Good.
10379,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,Are we terrible people?
10380,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,I don’t know. What do you want me to do?
10381,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,"Get him, bring him back."
10382,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,Are you sure?
10383,3,4,the pirate solution,Penny,Yeah.
10384,3,4,the pirate solution,Leonard,Okay. Howard come back.
10385,3,4,the pirate solution,Howard,"Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute."
10386,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we’d expect from this collision. Do you understand that we’re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?"
10387,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?
10388,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,I’m the astrophysicist. Astro means space.
10389,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Astro means star.
10390,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I’d be kicking your butt."
10391,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,English is your native language.
10392,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Okay, you got me there, but you’re wrong about this!"
10393,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.
10394,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca."
10395,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Caca?
10396,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,It means doo-doo.
10397,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me…"
10398,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Aha! So I am working with you.
10399,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"In this context, with me means for me."
10400,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Ah, well, in this context…"
10401,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Oh! If I’m wrong, prove it."
10402,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Okay. Here’s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.
10403,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"No, no, no, you’ve misstated the atomic weight of the target."
10404,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Let me finish.
10405,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,You’re defacing my work.
10406,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"I’m not defacing it, I’m fixing it."
10407,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Give me the eraser.
10408,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,No.
10409,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,I said give it to me.
10410,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,Come and get it.
10411,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Fine.
10412,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!"
10413,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,You are not my superior.
10414,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,I am in every way.
10415,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Oh, yeah? Can you do this?"
10416,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"Nice working with you. I’m sorry, for you."
10417,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Raj, Raj, Raj."
10418,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,I’m busy.
10419,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,Doing what?
10420,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"All right, you’ve made your point."
10421,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
10422,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.
10423,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,So you were wrong.
10424,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,I didn’t say that.
10425,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,That’s the only logical inference.
10426,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Nevertheless, I didn’t say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me."
10427,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,For you or with you?
10428,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,In this context for me could mean with me.
10429,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,"All right, but I have some conditions."
10430,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,I reject them all.
10431,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,I’ll take the job. See you Monday.
10432,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"Wait, you have to drive me home."
10433,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,How did you get here?
10434,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,I walked.
10435,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,So walk home.
10436,3,4,the pirate solution,Sheldon,"I can’t. There’s a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles."
10437,3,4,the pirate solution,Raj,All right.
10438,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"All right, Raj has played his phantom warlord card, and I am going to back him up with my strangling vines. Choke on that, sucka."
10439,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Okay, well, then I’ll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. That’s right, I did it. I cut ’em."
10440,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"Um, I have a question."
10441,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny."
10442,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Unless you have the carrot power.
10443,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"Okay, I’ve got another question. When does this get fun?"
10444,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Are we going to talk or are we going to play Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?
10445,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,Just play a potion card.
10446,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,Which one?
10447,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,It doesn’t matter. You can’t possibly win.
10448,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Sheldon, don’t ruin the game."
10449,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,How could he ruin the game?
10450,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"Given the cards that have already been played, Penny can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of Osiris."
10451,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,See? Ruined.
10452,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"Sheldon, that is incredible."
10453,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so."
10454,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.
10455,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as I’ve told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry."
10456,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"Well, I guess game’s over."
10457,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"Really? Oh, great. I mean, aw. Okay, I gotta go."
10458,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,Why?
10459,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"Because the last me I didn’t go, I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka."
10460,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Not Ka. Ka-ah.
10461,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,Ba-eye.
10462,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,See ya. Still can’t believe she’s going out with me.
10463,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,Nobody can.
10464,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"That reminds me, I have a bone to pick with you."
10465,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,What?
10466,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"You and I made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends."
10467,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Yeah, I don’t remember that."
10468,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees, no blue."
10469,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Oh, yeah."
10470,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"So you’ve been with Penny for like a month and a half now. Where’s my shorty, Morty?"
10471,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Howard, you can’t hold me to that."
10472,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Why not?
10473,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Because when I made that agreement, I didn’t think I’d ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would."
10474,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Hey, how come I wasn’t part of this deal?"
10475,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.
10476,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Oh, so that’s how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now I don’t get a hot girlfriend?"
10477,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"Yeah, Raj, that’s how it works."
10478,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,Damn.
10479,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?"
10480,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, no."
10481,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,But you have a whole bunch of ’em.
10482,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"Yes, I’ve moved to a four-napkin system. Lap, hands, face and personal emergencies. If you like, starting tomorrow, I’ll add a guest napkin, but I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do for you today."
10483,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,Good luck. That’s the face napkin.
10484,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"So, have you talked to Penny yet?"
10485,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"No, I haven’t."
10486,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Why not?
10487,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Because I’ve been busy, because I haven’t figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and I can’t stress how key this is, because I don’t want to."
10488,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"Leonard, a pact is a pact. You have to get Penny to fix me up."
10489,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"It’s not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Penny, do you have any friends you’d like to never hear from again?"
10490,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"Come on, I’m smart, I have good job and I have only three percent body fat."
10491,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"It’s true. I’ve seen him at the beach, he’s like a human chicken wing."
10492,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"Leonard, come on."
10493,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,Fine. I’ll ask if she has a friend for you.
10494,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,A hot friend.
10495,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,Right.
10496,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,And tall. I want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before they’re 20.
10497,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,I’ll see what I can do.
10498,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?"
10499,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"I’d imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, Raj, how are you, Raj? Given that you’re wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest."
10500,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,Why don’t I just tell you what I heard today.
10501,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,That would probably save us some time.
10502,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Saturday night at the comic book store, they’re having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five hundred dollars. If we team up, we’d be unstoppable."
10503,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge."
10504,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,What about the money?
10505,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,I have money.
10506,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,But this is other money.
10507,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,How does it different from the money I have?
10508,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,Half of it will be mine.
10509,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?
10510,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Leonard, help."
10511,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,Are you kidding? I couldn’t even talk him into giving me one of his freakin’ napkins.
10512,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"Wow, you really are a genius."
10513,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?"
10514,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"You mean, like a pinky swear?"
10515,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Okay, fine, like a pinky swear."
10516,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know, from Sesame Street?"
10517,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Yeah, I’m familiar with Bert and Ernie."
10518,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn’t speak again until middle school.
10519,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,Over puppets?
10520,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard."
10521,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you."
10522,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"Okay, I don’t know where you’re going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have."
10523,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we’d have her fix the other one up with one of her friends."
10524,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.
10525,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Well, I sure as hell wasn’t going to bring it up before sex, and during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so…"
10526,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,I’m not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.
10527,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Come on, it doesn’t have to be a good friend. And you know that deep down inside, Howard’s a really nice guy."
10528,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,The problem isn’t what’s on the inside. It’s the creepy candy coating.
10529,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?
10530,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave."
10531,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Betty and Veronica? Ugh.
10532,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Stuart,"Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern figurine’s coming in tomorrow. Want me to set one aside for you?"
10533,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.
10534,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Stuart,"All right, I won’t set one aside for you."
10535,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,But I must have it.
10536,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Stuart,"Okay, I’ll set one aside for you."
10537,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service."
10538,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Hey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament THE Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?"
10539,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Stuart,"Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer."
10540,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,Excuse me. Are you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher on Star Trek The Next Generation is going to be participating in your tournament?
10541,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Stuart,"Oh, I’m sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself?"
10542,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"You don’t understand. Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me."
10543,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Oh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while you’re playing in the tournament. Sign here."
10544,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure."
10545,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Ooh, it’ll be like a reunion then. Sign here."
10546,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"My arduous journey, however, was for naught. Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton."
10547,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. Sign here."
10548,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director Joel Schumacher, who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle."
10549,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Okay, I get it, he’s a bad guy. Sign here."
10550,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him."
10551,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"No doubt, sign here."
10552,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"From hell’s heart, I stab at thee."
10553,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Stuart,"All right, Raj, looks like you’re teamed up with die, Wil Wheaton, die."
10554,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"So, tell me more about the future mother of my children."
10555,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"She’s adorable, Howard. I think you’ll like her."
10556,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Great. So what did you tell her about me? Did you mention the body fat?
10557,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her."
10558,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"Good, good."
10559,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"I just told her you’re an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages…"
10560,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Six if you count Klingon.
10561,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Girls don’t count Klingon, Howard. Right?"
10562,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"Right. Oh, and I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother."
10563,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,What?
10564,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,I’m kidding.
10565,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,Another delightful surprise for her.
10566,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Sheldon, it’s your play. Sheldon."
10567,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. Game.
10568,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them, dude! Up top!"
10569,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"Look at him. Wil Wheaton, my old friend, I have chased you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition’s flames!"
10570,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in next generation. It’s a totally different set of characters."
10571,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?
10572,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round, we’ll face off for the championship."
10573,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed."
10574,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Dude, you have to stop talking like that. It’s really lame."
10575,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,Silence!
10576,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"So, Penny tells me you’re working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school. That’s pretty great, what are you studying?"
10577,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,Microbiology.
10578,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"Oh, cool. So you could study me."
10579,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,I don’t understand.
10580,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.
10581,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,"I know, I’m studying it."
10582,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,And I said you could study me ’cause I’m a tiny living thing. It’s a joke.
10583,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,Are you sure?
10584,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Do you like science-fiction?
10585,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,No.
10586,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Role-playing games?
10587,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?
10588,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Either.
10589,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,No.
10590,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,Gonna be a long night.
10591,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,"Yeah, well, it’s your fault."
10592,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,I had to ask. You didn’t have to say yes.
10593,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,You like magic?
10594,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,Not really.
10595,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Okay.
10596,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,"Long, long night."
10597,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"I play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord, then Captain Sweatpants, molten river. I play nightshade dryad, game, set and match. Now fetch me Wil Wheaton! bortaS bIr jablu’DI’ reH QaQqu’ nay’"
10598,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,Did that guy just say revenge is a dish best served cold in Klingon?
10599,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Stuart,I believe so.
10600,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,What is wrong with him?
10601,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Stuart,Everyone has a different theory.
10602,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,How about computers? Do you like computers?
10603,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,I use them. I don’t like them.
10604,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Okay… Puppies? Where do you stand on puppies?
10605,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,A puppy once bit my face.
10606,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Of course it did.
10607,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,How about that? Einstein was wrong.
10608,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,What?
10609,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Leonard,Approaching the speed of light doesn’t slow down time. Approaching them does.
10610,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"Excuse me. Oh, damn. It’s my mother."
10611,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,Are you going to answer it?
10612,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"I’m torn. She might be dying, and, you know, I wouldn’t want to miss that. On the other hand, if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over."
10613,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.
10614,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Not as crazy as my mother makes me.
10615,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,"Oh, yeah? Does your mother call you every day at work to see if you’ve had a healthy lunch?"
10616,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,My mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.
10617,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,"Okay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning like you’re nine years old?"
10618,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,You live with your mother?
10619,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,No. That’s the sad part.
10620,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"Ooh, rough. Okay, check this out. My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn’t pick up a disease from the other children."
10621,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,That’s nothing. I couldn’t ride a bicycle ’cause my mother was afraid I’d hit a bump and lose my virginity.
10622,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"Oh, wow. You didn’t, did you?"
10623,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.
10624,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,Corolla!
10625,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,Oh!
10626,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,More wine?
10627,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,I’d love some.
10628,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,"Listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime."
10629,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,Why?
10630,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,A catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I’ve been hoping for.
10631,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Bernadette,"Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke."
10632,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Howard,It’s a date.
10633,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Penny,Am I a matchmaker or what?
10634,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,Lava serpent.
10635,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Stuart,Nest of snakes.
10636,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,Underworld guardian.
10637,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,Underworld guardian. We skirmish to the death.
10638,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,Invisibility spell.
10639,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,Luminescence spell.
10640,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,Water nymph.
10641,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,Fire demon.
10642,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,Two-headed tiger.
10643,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,Three-headed lion.
10644,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,Sulphur.
10645,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,Brimstone.
10646,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Problem, Wil Wheaton?"
10647,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,Hang on.
10648,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"You’re holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of Zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game."
10649,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,I think he’s got me.
10650,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi. Having spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure."
10651,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,What?
10652,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge."
10653,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,"You went to the ’95 Dixie-Trek? Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died, and I had to go to her funeral."
10654,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,Your mee-maw died? That’s terrible.
10655,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,"Yeah, it was. But I’m really sorry that I disappointed you."
10656,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"No, no, I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw, I’d be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie."
10657,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,"It’s special relationship, isn’t it, between a boy and his grandmother?"
10658,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"Oh, yes."
10659,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!"
10660,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,"It’s okay, Sheldon. I let you down. I deserve it. Potion of Zancor."
10661,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,"What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell’s heart, stab at him!"
10662,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,I can’t.
10663,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,Sure you can. Do it! Do it!
10664,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,"No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can’t defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny."
10665,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Raj,No! Not enchanted bunny!
10666,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,"I call my mee-maw nana. And she’s going be very happy to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny. Game over, moon pie."
10667,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,I… I… I don’t understand. Your grandmother’s alive?
10668,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Wil Wheaton,"Oh, you catch on quick. Come on, Stewie, let’s get our prize money."
10669,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Stuart,That was fun.
10670,3,5,the creepy candy coating corollary,Sheldon,Wheaton! Wheaton! Wheaton!
10671,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Kites, ho!"
10672,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,Kites ho!
10673,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,Kites ho!
10674,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,All three,"Kites, ho!"
10675,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"Excuse me. You’re misusing the word ho. It’s an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!"
10676,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,The three guys,"Kites, ho!"
10677,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,"Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?"
10678,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"If you’re referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho."
10679,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,We’re heading out for some kite fighting.
10680,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,Kite fighting?
10681,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Oh, yeah. It’s an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport."
10682,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger."
10683,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,You want to come watch?
10684,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,"Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I’ve got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we’re just gonna watch the Nebraska game."
10685,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Oh. Football, sure."
10686,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,Good guess.
10687,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,"I would’ve invited you, but I know you’re not a football fan."
10688,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"No, no, I’m not, so, great. You’ve got plans doing something you like, I’ve got plans doing something I like, so it’s good."
10689,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,"Well, maybe we’ll hang out later, you know, after everybody’s gone."
10690,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Yeah, great."
10691,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,See ya.
10692,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Well, this sucks."
10693,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?"
10694,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"Leonard just realized that Penny’s been hiding him from her friends because he’s a tiny, little man who flies kites."
10695,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, that certainly would suck."
10696,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some string, add altitude and I’ll go under and cut his line."
10697,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Why wouldn’t Penny want her friends to meet me?
10698,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed."
10699,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Maybe Koothrappali’s right, maybe I embarrass her."
10700,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"You’re embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites."
10701,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Sorry.
10702,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,Sorry won’t bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!
10703,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"Oh, they think we’re flanking, they’re playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, two…"
10704,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,Whoa! Did you see that?
10705,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,See what?
10706,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"That chick, she smiled at me."
10707,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"No, she didn’t."
10708,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"Yes, she did."
10709,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"Come on, scissors, scissors!"
10710,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,Hold my line.
10711,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"Wait, what are you doing? I can’t scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!"
10712,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,Victory!
10713,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,Son of a bitch.
10714,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"You’re a sucky friend, you know that? A sucky, sucky friend."
10715,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,What was I supposed to do? She gave me that come-hither look.
10716,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.
10717,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,I would’ve caught up to her if I hadn’t pulled a hammy.
10718,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don’t have a hammy."
10719,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"So, Penny doesn’t want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?"
10720,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it in front of you."
10721,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Oh, how kind of her."
10722,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,Agreed. Most primates don’t show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?
10723,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"You always do this, you know? You ditch me for a woman you don’t have a shot with."
10724,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,I totally had a shot.
10725,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"With a woman you were chasing through a park? That’s not a shot, that’s a felony. What’s worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon, I don’t suppose there’s any chance you could give me my kite back?"
10726,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture."
10727,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,I have your kite. I have your kite.
10728,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Hey.
10729,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,Hi.
10730,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,How was your football party?
10731,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,It was pretty good. We won.
10732,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Oh, that’s excellent. It’s a weird figure of speech, isn’t it, we won when you weren’t actually playing. When we watch Star Wars, we don’t say, we defeated the Empire."
10733,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,I’m glad to hear it.
10734,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?"
10735,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,"Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?"
10736,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Well, you know, I just noticed I haven’t really met any of them."
10737,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,Sure you have.
10738,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?"
10739,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,Of course not.
10740,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don’t you stop me?
10741,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,"Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didn’t want you to be bored."
10742,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,I wouldn’t be bored. Why would I be bored?
10743,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,"Well, ’cause they’re not genius scientists."
10744,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren’t geniuses."
10745,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,Like who?
10746,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren’t geniuses. My point is, if we’re going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends."
10747,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,"Okay, great. Well, then why don’t you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us."
10748,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Another football game?
10749,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,They have them every week.
10750,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Did not know that.
10751,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,You wanted to meet my friends.
10752,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Sure, sure, just I don’t know much about football."
10753,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,"Oh, that’s okay, a lot of the guys’ girlfriends don’t know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen."
10754,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Great.
10755,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I’m starting to get this."
10756,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"Really? The only thing I’ve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections."
10757,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj."
10758,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"I’m just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help."
10759,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"Raj, what are you doing here? You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa."
10760,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"I’m sorry, are you under the impression that we’re still friends?"
10761,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"Oh come on, you’re not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?"
10762,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"It’s not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don’t have a shot with them."
10763,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,But I had a shot with that jogger.
10764,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her.
10765,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,It’s not a little scooter. It’s the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?
10766,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"There’s no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?"
10767,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there."
10768,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Sacks, sacks…"
10769,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,It’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.
10770,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Huh… Scrimmage…
10771,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.
10772,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Oh.
10773,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,Sheldon knows football?
10774,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Apparently.
10775,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?"
10776,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?"
10777,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot."
10778,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Unbelievable.
10779,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"If you’re interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken."
10780,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,So you could teach me?
10781,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,Football or chicken-fried meats?
10782,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Football. I’m going to Penny’s on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don’t want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.
10783,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"If you want to blend in with Penny’s friends, I’d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage."
10784,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It’ll be fun."
10785,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"That’s exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life."
10786,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Please, I’m asking you as a friend."
10787,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,Are you making this a tier one friendship request?
10788,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Yes.
10789,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,Fine.
10790,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,I really appreciate this.
10791,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen."
10792,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,I’m sorry?
10793,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"That’s how my father always began our football conversations. And if you’d like, after the game, I’ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself."
10794,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?
10795,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you’re wearing to watch football at Penny’s?
10796,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,What’s wrong with a football jersey?
10797,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress."
10798,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"I’s the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can’t believe they had one for dogs."
10799,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way."
10800,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Anyway, wish me luck."
10801,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny’s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?"
10802,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Well, I wouldn’t put it exactly that way."
10803,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,How would you put it?
10804,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Yeah, okay, like you said."
10805,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don’t you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho."
10806,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Good-Bye, Sheldon."
10807,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?
10808,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Yeah, no, I’m trying to fit in, not get laughed at."
10809,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,What’s funny about Cylon toast?
10810,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,It’s open.
10811,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"Hey, pal."
10812,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,What do you want?
10813,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,I brought you a little gift. New kite.
10814,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty."
10815,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?"
10816,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"Wow, you just don’t get it, do you? Buying me something pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away."
10817,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"Look, I admit I haven’t always been the best friend I could be."
10818,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"You’ve been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend."
10819,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,Stipulated.
10820,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you’re not even there."
10821,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"I know, I know."
10822,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,And where were you?
10823,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court."
10824,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,You’re impossible.
10825,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk."
10826,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. You’re just a douche."
10827,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"No. You know what? Maybe that’s what this whole thing’s about. You’re not mad at me, you’re mad at yourself."
10828,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"No, I’m mad at you. I hate myself, but I’m mad at you."
10829,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"Fine. You’re mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. We’ll go anywhere you want."
10830,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,I don’t know.
10831,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,Come on. Let me take you someplace nice.
10832,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,I… I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.
10833,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it’s… okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let’s go."
10834,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"Oh, why can’t I stay mad at you?"
10835,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?
10836,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,"Sweetie, that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship game."
10837,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Oh. Did not know that.
10838,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,How much beer have you had?
10839,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"None, why?"
10840,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we’re back live.
10841,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Okay, yeah. I can see the difference."
10842,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Guy in baseball hat,"Oh, where’s the flag, that’s intentional grounding."
10843,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Second guy,Totally.
10844,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul."
10845,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,"Here, have some pizza, sweetie."
10846,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Penny, you know I’m lactose intolerant."
10847,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,I know. I just need you stop talking.
10848,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny."
10849,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,"Sheldon, come in."
10850,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"Thank you. I’d like to make a sandwich, but I’m out of bread."
10851,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,There’s some in the fridge.
10852,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"You shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures."
10853,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,"On Earth, we say thank you."
10854,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?"
10855,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Mimesis?
10856,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.
10857,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,What the hell are you talking about?
10858,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"I’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink."
10859,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Oh, I guess so."
10860,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,"Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I’m taking Koothrappali’s Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?"
10861,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"I don’t want to fly kites, Sheldon. We’re watching football here."
10862,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Sheldon,I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.
10863,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he’s right, ’cause if he’s not, it’ll cost him one of his three time-Outs."
10864,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,"You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon."
10865,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"No, I’ll watch the end of the game. Besides, there’s only three minutes left."
10866,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,Until half time.
10867,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,This is just half? We’ve been here for hours.
10868,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,And you’re gonna be here for a couple more.
10869,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,"Oh, you’re kidding me."
10870,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,No.
10871,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Leonard,Nice meeting all of you.
10872,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Penny,"So, yeah, anyway, that’s my boyfriend. He is really smart."
10873,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you.
10874,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender’s and have some pie."
10875,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,I’d like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.
10876,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"Good. I’m glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?"
10877,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,Fine. Go ahead.
10878,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,No. This is our day.
10879,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"If you want to chase after her, chase after her."
10880,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn’t have a shot with a girl like that."
10881,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,Don’t put yourself down. You’re a very attractive man.
10882,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,You think so?
10883,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn’t kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal."
10884,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,"Yeah, well, it doesn’t matter ‘cause she wasn’t really smiling at me."
10885,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,"Actually, in this case, I think she was."
10886,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,Really?
10887,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,Yeah.
10888,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Howard,Bye.
10889,3,6,the cornhusker vortex,Raj,What a douche.
10890,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game."
10891,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It’s like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real."
10892,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,We must not be playing it right.
10893,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed."
10894,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.
10895,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Yay.
10896,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"You’re a natural at this, Penny. And as the first beta testers, you two’ll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday."
10897,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don’t think we can play on Sunday."
10898,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Why not?
10899,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?
10900,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport."
10901,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I can’t play ’cause I’m going with her, right?"
10902,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. He’s got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers."
10903,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,Wait. What are you talking about?
10904,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"My friend, Justin."
10905,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Pay attention, Leonard. That’s why she can’t play on Sunday."
10906,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,Who is this Justin?
10907,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Your turn, Leonard."
10908,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,I told you about him.
10909,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"No, you didn’t."
10910,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Roll the dice, Leonard."
10911,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Yeah, my friend from Omaha, plays the guitar. Anyway, he’s coming to L.A. looking for some session work, so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks."
10912,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?"
10913,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?
10914,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,He’s not some guy. He’s my friend.
10915,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you’re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend”?"
10916,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Well, he’s definitely not gay."
10917,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend’s couch. Yippee."
10918,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out."
10919,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked."
10920,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,I’ll just roll for you.
10921,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?
10922,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,What was your first clue?
10923,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Uh-oh! Industrial accident.
10924,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,You know what? Don’t talk to me like I’m an idiot.
10925,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,I’m not talking to you like you’re an idiot! I’m saying the whole idea is idiotic!
10926,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.
10927,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"How is that not talking to me like I’m an idiot? It’s my friend, it’s my couch, and it’s my freakin’ life!"
10928,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,It’s also your roll.
10929,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. Why don’t you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?"
10930,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Hey, if I want to invite the entire line up of Lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, I will, and it’s none of your business!"
10931,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?
10932,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Oh, now I’m a child? Well, at least I’m not an idiot anymore!"
10933,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,The two aren’t mutually exclusive!
10934,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Oh, you are such a…"
10935,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,What the hell is he doing?
10936,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,He’s drowning us out. He doesn’t like fighting.
10937,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Sheldon, just stop, look, the fight is over. Oh, and FYI, you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!"
10938,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"I heard of ’em. Didn’t know they were a band. Sheldon, she’s gone. You can turn off the blender."
10939,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
10940,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"No, we just had a little spat."
10941,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny’s forfeit, you have become the world’s first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?"
10942,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,I don’t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.
10943,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car."
10944,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon."
10945,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"It’s called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?"
10946,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"An old boyfriend who’s definitely not gay. That’s what a guy likes to hear, definitely."
10947,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"All right, I’ll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr."
10948,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!
10949,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her."
10950,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I’m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesn’t matter if you’re cool or not because I’m Penny and I’m pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you’re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I’m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!"
10951,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Leonard! Stop the car!
10952,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,What?
10953,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,I can’t listen to the two of you fight anymore.
10954,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Come on, come on, we’re late."
10955,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Calm down, we’ll make the movie."
10956,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we’ll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination."
10957,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Raj,"Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull."
10958,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Go, go, Power Rangers, go!"
10959,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Hey.
10960,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Hey. We’re, uh, going to the movies."
10961,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"No, we’re not. We’re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter."
10962,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Hang on. They’re showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn’t want to come, would you?"
10963,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Not really, no."
10964,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone’s civil, nobody’s fighting. Have a nice evening."
10965,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,Just give us a minute.
10966,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,"Oh, take all the time you need."
10967,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"So, are we going to talk about last night?"
10968,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Are you ready to apologize?
10969,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,No.
10970,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer, but thank you for playing."
10971,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Oh, come on. This is stupid."
10972,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Oh, there it is again! You think I’m stupid!"
10973,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"No, there’s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid."
10974,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Oh, yeah? well, there’s a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!"
10975,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"No, there isn’t! They’re synonyms!"
10976,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Raj,"Well, that was rather unpleasant."
10977,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,"Yeah, I don’t think I need my preshow urination anymore."
10978,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, we’re going to be late for the movies."
10979,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183.
10980,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Got it.
10981,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,Remember this one? Spider-Man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him. Want me to get it for you? It’ll help take your mind off things.
10982,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Stuart,"Hey, guys. What’s going on?"
10983,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits."
10984,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Stuart,"Oh, well, no problem. I was thinking of closing early and going home, but let’s face it, that’s just a slightly smaller lonely room filled with comic books."
10985,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it’s okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?"
10986,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,"No, I mean, she’s obviously way out of line."
10987,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,Thank you!
10988,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,"But if she dumps you, she’ll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you’ll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one. So the only question is, how long until you fold?"
10989,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,I am not going to fold.
10990,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Raj,"Well, excuse me, I don’t think Penny’s out of line at all. You don’t own her. It’s like my girl, Beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.”"
10991,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,"Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she should’ve backed off."
10992,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Raj,You mean like when a guy’s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn’t show up because he’s doing a juice fast with his mother?
10993,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,I didn’t know you were upset about that.
10994,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Raj,"Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset."
10995,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,"Okay, sorry."
10996,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Raj,"Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means you’re upset with a guy named Howard!"
10997,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,I said I’m sorry.
10998,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Raj,Sorry doesn’t make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!
10999,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,"Yeah, well, you think I was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say “Have you ever peed so much in your life?”"
11000,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Raj,"Oh, my God, you are such a mama’s boy."
11001,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,"Hey, don’t bring my mother into this!"
11002,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Raj,You brought your mother into this!
11003,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn’t quit drinkin’ I’d leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, ’cause I’m drunk as hell and you’re still here! Stop yelling! You’re making Sheldon cry! I’ll tell you what’s making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon."
11004,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,"Boy, what got him so upset?"
11005,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Raj,"Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldon’s upset."
11006,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
11007,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"This is a restaurant. It’s lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you’d be familiar with the paradigm."
11008,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Is Leonard coming?
11009,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize."
11010,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Well, that’s not gonna happen."
11011,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here."
11012,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Which is?
11013,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.
11014,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,I’m busy.
11015,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Excuse me, miss. I’d like to order lunch."
11016,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Fine. What do you want?
11017,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?"
11018,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Yes.
11019,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else’s sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?"
11020,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich."
11021,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"You can’t make a half-sandwich. If it’s not half of a whole sandwich, it’s just a small sandwich."
11022,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Okay, fine, it’s soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?"
11023,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Of course not. I’ll have my usual.
11024,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Great.
11025,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Aren’t you going to ask me if I want a beverage?
11026,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Don’t you usually get lemonade?
11027,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Yes.
11028,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Do you want lemonade?
11029,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Yes.
11030,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Anything else?
11031,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard."
11032,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,I am not going to apologize. I’ve done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.
11033,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.
11034,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Well, I’m sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn’t about you."
11035,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,I don’t follow.
11036,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Yeah, yeah, I’ll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go."
11037,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"All right, let’s assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong."
11038,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Leonard is wrong.
11039,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Considering the number of transgressions you’ve committed that he’s overlooked, don’t you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?"
11040,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"I’m coming. Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions I’ve committed?"
11041,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?
11042,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you’re making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?"
11043,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing."
11044,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,My singing?
11045,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"That’s actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn’t agree with it."
11046,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn’t he just said so?"
11047,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Because, according to him, you’re oversensitive and have a temper."
11048,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!"
11049,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,And she wonders why she’s constantly undertipped.
11050,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,Hey.
11051,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Oh, good, you’re home. I need you to do me a favour."
11052,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,Sure.
11053,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Go apologize to Penny.
11054,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,What?
11055,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Right now would be good.
11056,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Leonard!
11057,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Although, a few minutes ago would have been better."
11058,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"I hear you don’t like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality."
11059,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?
11060,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"It doesn’t matter why he told me. It’s true, isn’t it?"
11061,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Okay, yeah, it’s true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can’t live with is you casually informing me that some guy’s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!"
11062,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"That isn’t even your problem, the problem is you don’t trust me!"
11063,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don’t trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?"
11064,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again."
11065,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!
11066,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"No, I’m going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!"
11067,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,Why didn’t you say so?
11068,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!"
11069,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Well, I can’t read your mind, Penny!"
11070,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Really? Why not? You’re so smart, and I’m so dumb!"
11071,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Raj, Raj, Raj."
11072,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Raj,"Stop knocking! It’s open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and I can’t come home for my cousin Sanjay’s wedding."
11073,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Mrs Koothrappali,"Sheldon, ask our son what we’re supposed to say to Mr. and Mrs. Choudhry, whose daughter, Lakshmi is flying in from London, for the sole purpose of meeting him."
11074,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Raj,I didn’t ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.
11075,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Mrs Koothrappali,You should be thanking us!
11076,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Dr Koothrappali,"Yes, Lakshmi just got her stomach stapled. You have an opportunity to get in good with her before she loses weight, and her self-esteem goes up."
11077,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Raj,I don’t care! And why don’t you think I can find a woman for myself?
11078,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Mrs Koothrappali,"Because you’re 27, and the closest thing we have to a daughter-in-law is that Jewish boy Howard."
11079,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Raj,"Oh, that is completely below the belt. Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. I’ll come home for Sanjay’s wedding."
11080,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Sheldon!
11081,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,What are you doing? He’s not a lost dog.
11082,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Hey, why don’t you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?"
11083,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn’t."
11084,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,What stop sign?
11085,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!
11086,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard’s Mother,"Howard, answer the door! I’m busy!"
11087,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,"I’m busy too, you answer it."
11088,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard’s Mother,I can’t! I’m on the toilet!
11089,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,"For God’s sake, I don’t need to hear that! Can’t you just say, I’m busy?"
11090,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard’s Mother,"I said I’m busy, but that wasn’t good enough for you!"
11091,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,"You know what? I hope it’s one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head."
11092,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard’s Mother,"Well, if it’s a home invader, don’t tell them I’m on the toilet!"
11093,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Howard,"There’s no one there. You’re hearing things, you crazy old lady!"
11094,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?"
11095,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Stuart,"Yeah, he’s, uh, over in the graphic novel section. Built himself a little nest."
11096,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,Thank you.
11097,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Stuart,"Uh, Penny?"
11098,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,Yeah?
11099,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Stuart,Is everything okay?
11100,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,What do you mean?
11101,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Stuart,"Uh, Sheldon told me you and Leonard were having a fight?"
11102,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Oh, yeah, kind of. It’s, it’s no big thing."
11103,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Stuart,"Oh, good, good."
11104,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Stuart,I love you.
11105,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,I’m not leaving until you talk to me.
11106,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"All right, what’s going on?"
11107,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"It’s a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he’s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we’re in, but he can’t perceive us."
11108,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Don’t flatter yourself. I’m just ignoring you.
11109,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Come on, Sheldon, let’s go home. Look, we’re done fighting."
11110,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"I’ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I’m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad’s meatloaf, and my dad’s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates."
11111,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Okay, there’s going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting."
11112,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,Really? Where’s your friend Justin going to sleep?
11113,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Yeah, where’s he gonna sleep?"
11114,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Oh, my God, would you let this go?!"
11115,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Stuart,I’d let it go.
11116,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,Why should I let it go? Why don’t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep?
11117,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Oh, for God’s sakes. So, you have childhood issues, we all have childhood issues, at some point, you just need to grow up and get past them."
11118,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? Look, let’s just… Sheldon, please, try and understand. Look, Leonard and I are in a relationship, and occasionally, we’re going to fight. But no matter what happens between us, we will always love you. Right, Leonard?"
11119,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,Always is a long time. Sure. Always.
11120,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"You know, how about we buy you this robot, and then we all go home?"
11121,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,I want that one.
11122,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Okay, you can have that one."
11123,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,"Oh, come on, he’s just going to play with it twice, and then it’ll end up in his closet with all the other junk."
11124,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Buy him the robot, Leonard."
11125,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,"Can I get this comic book, too?"
11126,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"Yes, you can."
11127,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Stuart,We meet again.
11128,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Leonard,So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn’t sleep on your couch?
11129,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Penny,"He’s a musician. He’ll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to."
11130,3,7,the guitarist amplification,Sheldon,I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.
11131,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,How much time do we have?
11132,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,"Uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower."
11133,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"Okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west. That means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93."
11134,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,Anything yet?
11135,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,"Uh, we have a signal, but there’s no frame lock."
11136,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"Hang on, how about now?"
11137,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,We did it. We have the west coast feed of HBO.
11138,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"Ooh, Real Sex."
11139,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,Big deal. Every time I watch that show it’s old women putting condoms on cucumbers.
11140,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"Alright, let’s see what’s on the east coast feed."
11141,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,"Oh, hey. Dune."
11142,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"Not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert."
11143,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,Too bad Sheldon couldn’t come with us.
11144,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"Yes, it’s not the same without him."
11145,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"Oh, this sucks, I’m switching back to Real Sex."
11146,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Sheldon’s log, stardate 63345.3. While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship."
11147,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"And good evening to you, Siam Palace. This is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m going to be dining alone this evening, so I’ll be reducing my usual order. I’d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heaven’s sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings."
11148,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Sheldon help!
11149,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store."
11150,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny.."
11151,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Come in! Hurry!
11152,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Penny?
11153,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,I’m back here.
11154,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny.."
11155,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"Oh, for god’s sakes, I’m in the bathroom!"
11156,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Shall I come back at a better time?
11157,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Get in here! Hurry! Don’t you dare knock.
11158,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Hello.
11159,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder."
11160,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.
11161,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,What?
11162,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Tubs are slippery.
11163,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,I know. I slipped.
11164,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.
11165,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?"
11166,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,They’re holding umbrellas.
11167,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,What?
11168,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,The ducks in my tub.
11169,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Uh-huh.
11170,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"They’re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas."
11171,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room."
11172,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Well, assuming you’re correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so."
11173,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"Okay, can you drive me?"
11174,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,I don’t drive.
11175,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"Well, I can’t drive!"
11176,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Well, it seems we’ve reached an impasse."
11177,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Ow.
11178,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.
11179,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"No, no, no, I can’t wait that long, you got to help me, please."
11180,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.
11181,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,No one’s saying that. Let’s go.
11182,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash."
11183,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,"I wish Penny didn’t have to work, she loves camping."
11184,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"Yeah, that would have been great. You and Penny having sex in the tent while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus."
11185,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"Okay, the best I can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. Mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation."
11186,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,Wow. Wonderful. How old are they?
11187,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"Oh I don’t know, 50, 55."
11188,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"Oh, menopause, nature’s birth control."
11189,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,"Come on, you guys can’t be that hard up."
11190,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,I am.
11191,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"Yeah, me, too."
11192,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"Look, they gave me homemade cookies."
11193,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,"Of course, they did. That’s what grandmothers do."
11194,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"So, what are we waiting for?"
11195,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"Relax, I said we’d stop by a little later after they have their nap."
11196,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,Good idea. They’ll be refreshed.
11197,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,Cookie?
11198,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"Yeah, thank you. Mmmm."
11199,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,"Mmmm, not bad."
11200,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"Yeah, very tasty. Well, so tell me more about these teachers."
11201,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,Not much to tell. They had a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead shirts.
11202,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,Huh. Mmm. Good cookies.
11203,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?
11204,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"I don’t need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt."
11205,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.
11206,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,One was already in an accident.
11207,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"That doesn’t mean one won’t be in another, especially if I’m driving."
11208,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!"
11209,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Okay, here."
11210,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Seriously? Those shorts with that top?
11211,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,All right.
11212,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"No… No… Oh, that’s cute."
11213,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,We should have you checked for a concussion.
11214,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"Okay, now, you got to help me put these on."
11215,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,All right.
11216,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,But don’t look.
11217,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Don’t look?
11218,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,I don’t want you to see me naked.
11219,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Oh. Well, that’s understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice."
11220,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"Yeah, great."
11221,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,They always look. It never ends well.
11222,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve."
11223,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Ok.
11224,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Is that my arm?
11225,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,It doesn’t feel like an arm.
11226,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"Then, maybe you should let it go."
11227,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,All righty.
11228,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,"Stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
11229,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"Up above the world so high, like little diamonds in the sky."
11230,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"That’s beautiful, dude. You should… You should write that down before someone steals it."
11231,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"So, when do the meteors get here?"
11232,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"The meteors don’t get here, the earth is moving into their path."
11233,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,"I can feel it. I can feel the earth moving. It’s moving too fast. Raj, slow it down."
11234,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"Okay, how’s that?"
11235,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,Better. Thanks.
11236,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"Stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
11237,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,What’s so funny?
11238,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,It’s your American accent. Everything you say sounds stupid.
11239,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"Stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
11240,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"For the record, I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle."
11241,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"You have your learner’s permit, right?"
11242,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator."
11243,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Good.
11244,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Didn’t work out well.
11245,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"All right, can we please go?"
11246,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"One moment. According to my driver’s ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver’s door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There’s the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?"
11247,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,It’s right there.
11248,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Where is the passenger side mirror?
11249,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"In a parking lot in Hollywood. Now, can we please go?"
11250,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat. Whee! Oh, dear. I’m going to have to start again."
11251,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"If I could speak the language of rabbits, they would be amazed, and I would be their king."
11252,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,I hate my name. It has nerd in it. Len nerd.
11253,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.
11254,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,I would be kind to my rabbit subjects. At first.
11255,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,You know what’s a cool name? Angelo. That has angel and jell-o in it.
11256,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,It was my Uncle Murray’s funeral. We were all back at my Aunt Barbara’s house. Our eyes locked over the pickled herring. We never meant for it to happen.
11257,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France, but the rabbits, they hate me and don’t come. I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch."
11258,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,"People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, how’s it goin’?"
11259,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"To this day, I can’t look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. Oh, cousin Jeanie."
11260,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Could you please drive a little faster?
11261,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Oh, I think we’re going sufficiently fast. What’s that?"
11262,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.
11263,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"That can’t be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station."
11264,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,No. The light has been on since I bought the car.
11265,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.
11266,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"It’s not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock."
11267,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise’s check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately."
11268,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"Oh, god, I’m gonna lose the arm."
11269,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?"
11270,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,What?
11271,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?
11272,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"It’s not soup, it’s courage."
11273,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"No, it isn’t. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup."
11274,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,How did you see it? You said you wouldn’t look.
11275,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks."
11276,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,Anything?
11277,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,No. That was the last pudding cup.
11278,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,No! What about Slim Jims?
11279,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,"That’s what he used to eat his pudding, remember?"
11280,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,Right! That was so good! Sweety and meaty at the same time.
11281,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"Wait. Wait, wait. So you’re saying we’re out of food?"
11282,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,The only thing in here are blue ice packs.
11283,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"I know they’re poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops."
11284,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,"Oh, god, I am so hungry."
11285,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,Me too. Check and see if we have any more pudding.
11286,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,Okay.
11287,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"All right, there’s no need to bark at me. According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, you’ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone. We have to fill these out. Describe illness or injury."
11288,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,I dislocated my shoulder.
11289,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,All right. And how did the accident occur?
11290,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,You ready know that.
11291,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?"
11292,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,No.
11293,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Kidney disease?
11294,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,No.
11295,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Migraines?
11296,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Getting one.
11297,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Are you currently pregnant?
11298,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,No.
11299,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.
11300,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Change migraine to yes.
11301,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,When was your last menstrual period?
11302,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"Oh, next question."
11303,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"I’ll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera."
11304,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?"
11305,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Episodes of sub psychotic rage.
11306,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Ass.
11307,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Possible Tourette’s. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock."
11308,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don’t know, comforting?"
11309,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"I’m sorry. There, there. Everything’s going to be fine. Sheldon’s here."
11310,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Thanks. That’s much better.
11311,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"Oh, I’m so hungry!"
11312,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,Will you shut up? We’re all hungry.
11313,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"Okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. Easy target. Big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos."
11314,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,What kind of score are we looking at?
11315,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"Hot dogs, buns, s’mores, I mean, it’s a freaking 7-11."
11316,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,"All right, everyone grab flashlights."
11317,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"Oh, my god, could it be? Yes! My mother put an I love you brisket in my backpack."
11318,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,"Quick, get forks."
11319,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,"You don’t need forks. It’s so tender, it falls apart in your hands."
11320,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,He’s right.
11321,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard,I feel like we’re forgetting something important.
11322,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"Me, too. But what?"
11323,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,Maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?
11324,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Leonard and Raj together,Yes! Yes!
11325,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don’t operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool."
11326,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I’d say that.
11327,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.
11328,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"You know, people think you’re this weird robot man who’s so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it’s like that movie Wall-E at the end. You’re so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs."
11329,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"That’s a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it."
11330,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Sing “Soft Kitty” to me.
11331,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,“Soft Kitty” is for when you’re sick. You’re not sick.
11332,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.
11333,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Sheldon,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…"
11334,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Penny,"Wait, wait. Let’s sing it as a round. I’ll start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… See that’s where you come in. I’ll start over. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur… I’ve got all night, Sheldon. Soft kitty, warm kitty…little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty purr, purr, purr."
11335,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,"…And the next morning when he woke up, he rolled over and realized… duh-duh-duh! …she was his cousin."
11336,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,That’s still not funny.
11337,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,That’s still not funny.
11338,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,And she was my second cousin.
11339,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,And she was my second cousin.
11340,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Howard,You’re a real douche.
11341,3,8,the adhesive duck deficiency,Raj,Who cares? You slept with your cousin.
11342,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"So two years later, there’s a knock on the door, guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, “What the heck was all that about?”"
11343,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,I don’t really get it.
11344,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Well, see, it took two years for the snail to… not important."
11345,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,Can I ask you a question?
11346,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,Sure.
11347,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,Where do you think this is going?
11348,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"To be honest, I was hoping at least second base."
11349,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,You’re so funny. You’re like a stand-up comedian.
11350,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"A Jewish stand-up comedian, that’d be new."
11351,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,"Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish."
11352,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"No, I was just… never mind."
11353,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,"Look, Howard, this is our third date and we both know what that means."
11354,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,We do?
11355,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,Sex.
11356,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,You’re kidding.
11357,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,But I need to know whether you’re looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.
11358,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Okay, just to be clear, there’s only one correct answer, right? It’s not like chicken or fish on an airplane?"
11359,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,Maybe you need to think about it a little.
11360,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"You know, it’s not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship."
11361,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,Call me when you figure it out.
11362,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,Three dates means sex? Who knew?
11363,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Greetings, homies, homette."
11364,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,Why are you back from your date so early?
11365,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"In romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more."
11366,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,What exactly does that mean?
11367,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,He struck out.
11368,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?"
11369,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,"Actually, I’ve never had three dates with the same woman."
11370,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates."
11371,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?"
11372,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open."
11373,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your current conversation. What are you talking about?"
11374,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.
11375,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?"
11376,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"Never mind, what’s your announcement?"
11377,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know…"
11378,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Kripke,"Hey, Cooper, I hear you’re going to be on the wadio with Ira Fwatow from Science Fwiday next week."
11379,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends."
11380,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Kripke,My pweasure.
11381,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,My thank you was not sincere.
11382,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Kripke,"But my pweasure is. Let me ask you a question, at what point did National Public Wadio have to start scwaping the bottom of the bawwel for its guests? Eh, don’t answer, it’s wetowical."
11383,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I’m sorry you had to hear that.
11384,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,Are you really going to be on NPR?
11385,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"Yes, they’re interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It’s pledge week and they’re trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy."
11386,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"Very cool, congratulations."
11387,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"Thank you. My mother is very excited. She’s convening her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul."
11388,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,"I was on the radio once. I called in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays, “Fever 104, ?? ?? ??? ????? ????? ?? ??.” That means"
11389,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they’re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you."
11390,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Excuse me, I have a master’s degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis."
11391,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,Yes. Look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.
11392,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don’t have to do it."
11393,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,"In fact, it’s better if you don’t, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad."
11394,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,"Hi, guys."
11395,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,Hey.
11396,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,Hello.
11397,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,"Yo, Raj, talk to me. I’m sorry, just screwing with you. Hey, Howard, why haven’t you called Bernadette?"
11398,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,Did she say something?
11399,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,"Yeah, she said she hasn’t heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?"
11400,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and I’m not sure she’s my type."
11401,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?
11402,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Look, Bernadette is really nice. I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different."
11403,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,Different how?
11404,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers, or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica."
11405,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,Are you high?
11406,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,You’d have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.
11407,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Okay, now you’re just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be."
11408,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,"Howard, you’re going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you’re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?"
11409,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Hey, just because you settled doesn’t mean I have to."
11410,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"Excuse me, I’m sitting here."
11411,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,"Hey, I did not settle for Leonard. I mean, obviously, he isn’t the kind of guy I usually go out with, you know, physically."
11412,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"Again, I’m right here."
11413,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,"My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath."
11414,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"I am here, right? You see me."
11415,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Hey, I’m interested in what’s inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry?"
11416,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Yes, you’re delicious caramel, too."
11417,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,"All right, you know what, I will tell you why it’s wrong…"
11418,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"Excuse me, may I interject?"
11419,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,What?
11420,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line."
11421,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Thank you, Sheldon."
11422,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question."
11423,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Radio,"This is Ira Flatow and you’re listening to NPR’s Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
11424,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Kripke,"Oh, this is going to be a wiot."
11425,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Radio,"Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper."
11426,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"My pleasure, Ira."
11427,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Ira,"Now, let’s talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?"
11428,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole."
11429,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Ira,"Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection."
11430,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole."
11431,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I’m going to kill you!"
11432,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,So nice you could join me this evening. You’re looking lovely as always.
11433,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Katee Sackhoff,"Thanks, Howard. Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies."
11434,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Come on, Katee, don’t make it sound so cheap."
11435,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Katee,"I’m sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act."
11436,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Thank you. So, shall we get started?"
11437,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Katee,Sure. But can I ask you a question first?
11438,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,You want to play Cylon and colonist?
11439,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Katee,No. I want to know why you’re playing make-believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight.
11440,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"You mean, Bernadette?"
11441,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Katee,"No, I mean Princess Leia. Of course I mean Bernadette. She’s a wonderful girl and she really likes you."
11442,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"I know, but she’s not you."
11443,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Katee,"I’m not me. The real me is in Beverly Hills going out with a tall, handsome, rich guy."
11444,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,Really? Tall?
11445,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Katee,Six-four.
11446,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,Ouch.
11447,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Katee,"The point is, you’ve got a wonderful girl in your life, and you’re ignoring her in order to spend your nights in the bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth."
11448,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard’s Mother,Howard! What are you doing in there?
11449,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,I’m taking a bath!
11450,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard’s Mother,I hope that’s all you’re doing! We share that tub!
11451,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,Don’t remind me!
11452,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Oh, man. All soaped up and no place to go."
11453,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"How ya doin’, buddy?"
11454,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I’m doing?
11455,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"Come on, it wasn’t that bad."
11456,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,What do you want?
11457,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,"We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you."
11458,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you."
11459,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,It wasn’t funny.
11460,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,I thought it was funny.
11461,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,Raj.
11462,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,You laughed.
11463,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,Did you laugh?
11464,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back."
11465,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,I refuse to sink to his level.
11466,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,"You can’t sink. With all that helium in you, you’re lucky you don’t float away."
11467,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,Are you really admitting defeat?
11468,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,I never admit defeat.
11469,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,Good.
11470,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again."
11471,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?
11472,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,"I don’t think that’s possible, dude."
11473,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,You’re not helping.
11474,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,"I didn’t come to help, I came to mock."
11475,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane."
11476,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,"That’s true. He didn’t just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham’s water supply."
11477,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke."
11478,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"No, no."
11479,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,It’s a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that’d be untraceable in an autopsy.
11480,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"Okay, uh, that’s the spirit, but, um, let’s dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance."
11481,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? He’ll sit down, it’ll sound like he’s flatulent, even though he’s not."
11482,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,Let’s keep thinking.
11483,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,"Oh, gee, you’re too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels."
11484,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Yeah, I came to talk to Bernadette. She’s working today, right?"
11485,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,"Yes, but I don’t think she wants to see you."
11486,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,Why not?
11487,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,"Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. Plus, I’ve kind of been talkin’ some smack about ya."
11488,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,"Hello, Howard."
11489,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you."
11490,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,"I can’t now, I’m working."
11491,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"This will only take a second. You asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and I did. Bernadette? Will you marry me?"
11492,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,Is this more comedy that I don’t understand?
11493,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"No. I’m serious. I’m never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real."
11494,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,"So, this isn’t a joke?"
11495,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,No.
11496,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,Then you’re insane.
11497,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,I prefer to think of myself as quirky.
11498,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,"Howard, we’ve only been on three dates. We haven’t even had sex yet."
11499,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,Fair enough. When’s your break?
11500,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,Wow.
11501,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,Don’t you just hate when this happens?
11502,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,Wow.
11503,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"All right, how’s this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide."
11504,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,What’s this?
11505,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we’re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen."
11506,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,Foamy vengeance.
11507,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"Yes, exactly."
11508,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke’s office?"
11509,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke’s lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor’s shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling."
11510,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,"Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor."
11511,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"You flatter me, sir."
11512,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"Let me guess, motion sensors?"
11513,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha."
11514,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,"I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even."
11515,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity."
11516,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,Here comes Kripke!
11517,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,Who is that with him?
11518,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,I believe that’s the president of the university.
11519,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!
11520,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,There is no abort.
11521,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,"Well, how could you not put in an abort?"
11522,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"I made a boo-boo, all right?"
11523,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Kripke,"I think the board will weally appweciate how well we’re using that NSA gwant, Pwesident Seibert. Wight here we have a micwo-contwolled pwasma…"
11524,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.
11525,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Leonard,At least they don’t know it was you.
11526,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Sheldon,"Hello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If you’d like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise."
11527,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Raj,"Well, I’m going back to India. What’s your plan?"
11528,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,"Hey, here’s your tip from table seven."
11529,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,"Oh, thanks."
11530,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,Mm-hmm.
11531,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,Testing. Check. Check two.
11532,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,"Oh, now what?"
11533,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,You want me to throw him out?
11534,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,"No, that’s okay."
11535,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,"Are you sure? He’s small. I bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him."
11536,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,I want to dedicate this number to a great gal who I’ve done wrong.
11537,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"Bernadette, I am so sorry for trying to propose to you, Bernadette, you found it creepy but that’s just the kind of thing I do. I know now it was too soon to talk of love. It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. But, Bernadette, give me one more chance, sweet Bernadette, I’ll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet Bernadette, I dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet Bernadette. Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz, Bernadette…"
11538,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Penny,"Oh, I am so sorry."
11539,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Bernadette,Are you kidding? That’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever done for me.
11540,3,9,the vengeance formulation,Howard,"…Bernadette! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!"
11541,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Hey, Leonard, check this out."
11542,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Leonard, she’s doing it again."
11543,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.
11544,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.
11545,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,You want me to put it back?
11546,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Leonard.
11547,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.
11548,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"What’s up, my nerdizzles? Raj, Sheldon, I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette."
11549,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Hello.
11550,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Leonard, Penny, you know my girlfriend Bernadette."
11551,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,Yeah. Hey.
11552,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Bernadette, say fo’shizzle to my nerdizzles."
11553,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,I don’t think I can. I don’t have Howard’s street cred.
11554,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"I hope it’s all right, I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner."
11555,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,"Sure. The more, the merrier."
11556,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Wait, no, that’s a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we’d be suffocating."
11557,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,Sheldon…
11558,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Don’t Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six."
11559,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Oh, come on, it’s fine. We’ll just put it all on the table, you know, family style."
11560,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Oh, sure. And while we’re at it, why don’t we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?"
11561,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,"Relax, it’ll be fine, sit down, you guys."
11562,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Everyone,NO!
11563,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,What?
11564,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Oh, yeah, you can’t sit there."
11565,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,Why not?
11566,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,That’s where Sheldon sits.
11567,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,He can’t sit somewhere else?
11568,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he’s warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, it’s directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn’t direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted."
11569,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Perhaps there’s hope for you after all.
11570,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"Ooh, I love your shoes."
11571,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren’t they?"
11572,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,Where’d you get them?
11573,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Shoes for Less.
11574,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,I’ve been meaning to go over there.
11575,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Oh, great selection, great prices."
11576,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,My mother was right. Hell is real.
11577,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Come on, Sheldon. let the womenfolk chat."
11578,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Womenfolk?
11579,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Gals? Chicks? Utero-Americans?
11580,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Just eat your dinner.
11581,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"Don’t take him too seriously, a lot of what he says is intended as humour."
11582,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Yeah, well, I don’t think it’s very funny."
11583,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh."
11584,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Howard, never let her go."
11585,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"So, Leonard, Howard says you’re working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics."
11586,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,I am. Are you interested in physics?
11587,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn’t gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics. Or ice dancing."
11588,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,"Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we’re testing the phase shift due to an electric potential."
11589,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,That’s amazing.
11590,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Yes. Leonard’s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.
11591,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"While I appreciate the oh, snap, I’m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear."
11592,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,Are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?
11593,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,"Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?"
11594,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"Oh, yeah, show me. In microbiology, the most exciting thing I get to work with is yeast."
11595,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Howard?
11596,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Yeah?
11597,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?
11598,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,What?
11599,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Bazinga. I don’t care.
11600,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Raj,"Ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber."
11601,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,That’s not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.
11602,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Raj,"And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it’s a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can’t drive."
11603,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Just need a little more practice.
11604,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Raj,"What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart."
11605,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,nan
11606,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?"
11607,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"It’s not about shoes, is it? I don’t think I could go through that again."
11608,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,It’s not about shoes.
11609,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Then speak.
11610,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Um, actually, can we do it in private?"
11611,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,All right.
11612,3,10,the gorilla experiment,"Go away. I agree, it’s rude, but she asked for privacy.",nan
11613,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Thanks, Raj. Okay, so here’s the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?"
11614,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"A little physics? There’s no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies."
11615,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Yeah, okay, cool. I don’t need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does."
11616,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Why can’t Leonard teach you?
11617,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,‘Cause I want to surprise him.
11618,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Can’t you surprise him in some other way? For example, I’m sure he’d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment."
11619,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me."
11620,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable."
11621,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,You’re sitting here playing video games all day.
11622,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?"
11623,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Sure. I did the one with the frogs.
11624,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,The one with the frogs.
11625,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer."
11626,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Penny, I don’t think so."
11627,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, it’ll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment."
11628,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics."
11629,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Great! It’s a little insulting, but great. I’ll be KoKo."
11630,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes."
11631,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Hey, fellas. This is my girlfriend Bernadette. My girlfriend Bernadette."
11632,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,Who are all those people?
11633,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Have no idea. Hey, Leonard."
11634,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,Hi.
11635,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,"Hey, look, it’s Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette."
11636,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Thought I’d give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.
11637,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,He doesn’t mean salt mines. He means where he works.
11638,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,"Yeah, no, I got it."
11639,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"So, how’s your experiment going?"
11640,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,"Ah, terrific. We’re getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow."
11641,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"Boy, I’d love to see that."
11642,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,You’re welcome to come.
11643,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"Really? Oh, that’d be great. How exciting is that?"
11644,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Like Hanukkah in July.
11645,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,Do they have that?
11646,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,No.
11647,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"Oh. You got me again. This isn’t non-fat yogurt, this is fatty fat fat. Excuse me."
11648,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?"
11649,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,Sure.
11650,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Thanks, honey."
11651,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"All right, what is your deal?"
11652,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,Excuse me?
11653,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?
11654,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,Yeah? So?
11655,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Wow! You really are a piece of work. It’s not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?"
11656,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,What are you talking about?
11657,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Don’t play innocent with me. I practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.
11658,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,Has it ever worked?
11659,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Not so far, but that’s not the point!"
11660,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,"Howard, relax, I’m not interested in your girlfriend."
11661,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"I hope not, because you don’t want to mess with me. I’m crazy."
11662,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,I believe you.
11663,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Research journal, entry one. I’m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching Penny physics. I’m calling it Project Gorilla."
11664,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
11665,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. I’ve extended a friendly casual greeting.
11666,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Ready to get started?
11667,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Where’s your notebook?"
11668,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Um, I don’t have one."
11669,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,How are you going to take notes without a notebook?
11670,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,I have to take notes?
11671,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,How else are you gonna study for the tests?
11672,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,There’s gonna be a test?
11673,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Tests. Here. It’s college-ruled. I hope that’s not too intimidating.
11674,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Thank you.
11675,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"You’re welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It’s at this point that you’ll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins."
11676,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Ancient Greece?
11677,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. It’s a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, you’ve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?"
11678,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard’s work?"
11679,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we’re going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.
11680,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Twenty six hundred years?
11681,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, it’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece… Yes, Penny?"
11682,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,I have to go to the bathroom.
11683,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Can’t you hold it?
11684,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Not for twenty six hundred years.
11685,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted."
11686,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,Howard?
11687,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Huh?
11688,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,It unhooks in the front.
11689,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Oh, that explains a lot."
11690,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard’s Mother,"Howard, I’m home!"
11691,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Of course.
11692,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard’s Mother,"Senior fitness was cancelled. It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike. I’m fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel."
11693,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"That’s great, Ma!"
11694,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard’s Mother,What’s great about an 80-year-old Armenian man with half his chin scraped off?
11695,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,I guess I should go.
11696,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"No, no, don’t move. Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?"
11697,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard’s Mother,Lamb stew? I’d have to go to the supermarket.
11698,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Please? I got a real hankering.
11699,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard’s Mother,"Oh, I can’t say no to my little tushy face. I’ll be back soon."
11700,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Thanks, Ma."
11701,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard’s Mother,Do you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?
11702,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!
11703,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard’s Mother,"You’re right! When you’re right, you’re right! What if they’re out of the Le Seur?"
11704,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Then get the regular!
11705,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard’s Mother,All right! You don’t have to yell!
11706,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Sorry about that.
11707,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,Let me just put that on vibrate.
11708,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,I’m already on vibrate.
11709,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"You know, that one I got. Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?"
11710,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Uh, what do you mean?"
11711,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.
11712,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Really? He said that?
11713,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"You’re not jealous of Leonard, are you?"
11714,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Me? No. I may have mentioned that it’s a little inappropriate to be asking another man’s girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man.
11715,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?
11716,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"I didn’t say anything like that. I said Leonard has to ask my permission. Come on, I don’t want to eat lamb stew with my mother. Damn, I was this close on the bra."
11717,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let’s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?"
11718,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Uh, we know that… Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?"
11719,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don’t write that down!"
11720,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Sorry.
11721,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?"
11722,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,I don’t know.
11723,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
11724,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Hey! You don’t have to be so mean!
11725,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,I’m sorry. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
11726,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"No, you just suck at teaching."
11727,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?"
11728,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Oh, God, Sheldon, look I’m trying to understand, but you’re going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?"
11729,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,All right. It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
11730,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Not that far back!
11731,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?
11732,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,I don’t know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?
11733,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Greece.
11734,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Damn it!
11735,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"There’s no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which…? MA equals MG?"
11736,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Squared?
11737,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,No.
11738,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Aristotle?
11739,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,No.
11740,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Five?
11741,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Oh!
11742,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Then I don’t know.
11743,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,Why are you crying?
11744,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Because I’m stupid!
11745,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"That’s no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad."
11746,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?"
11747,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.
11748,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Really? That’s it? Well, that doesn’t sound so complicated."
11749,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,It’s not. That’s why Leonard does it.
11750,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?"
11751,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,A good question.
11752,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,Thank you.
11753,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,"And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?"
11754,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Oh, balls."
11755,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Sheldon,It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
11756,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Okay, I got a bone to pick with you."
11757,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,What did I do now?
11758,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me."
11759,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,What?
11760,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"We were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you."
11761,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.
11762,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Yeah, but that’s not what you tell her."
11763,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,What was I supposed to tell her?
11764,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"I don’t know, something that doesn’t make me come off as a petty, jealous douche."
11765,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,And what would that be?
11766,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Come on, do I have to think of everything?"
11767,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"Hey, Leonard. Am I too late to see the experiment? Oh, hi."
11768,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Hi.
11769,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,What are you doing here?
11770,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Same thing you’re doing here. I came to see Leonard’s experiment.
11771,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"No, you didn’t. You said Leonard’s experiment was stupid."
11772,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,You told her my experiment was stupid?
11773,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"I was just repeating what Sheldon said. Let’s not get off topic, Bernadette, I need to apologize. I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with."
11774,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,"Should I, um, leave you two alone?"
11775,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"No, Leonard, you should hear this."
11776,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,"Okay, good, ’cause I wasn’t really gonna go."
11777,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is I’m not."
11778,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,We’re shocked.
11779,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.
11780,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,"Or loud noises, clowns and nuns."
11781,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,But I now realize how foolish that is.
11782,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.
11783,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,It was a full turtleneck. Why aren’t you helping me?
11784,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,I don’t know. Maybe because I’m crazy?
11785,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Howard,"Bernadette, please, I’m asking you to give me another chance."
11786,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"What do you think, Leonard? Should I give him another chance?"
11787,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,It’s up to you. He didn’t call your experiment stupid.
11788,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"Come here, tushy face."
11789,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,"Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now."
11790,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Bernadette,"Raj, you should’ve seen Leonard’s experiment. The interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on."
11791,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Leonard,I’m glad you enjoyed it. Most people aren’t that interested in what I do.
11792,3,10,the gorilla experiment,Penny,"Actually, that’s not true, Leonard. In fact, recently I’ve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That’s it. That’s all I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist."
11793,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Oh, I always tear up when the Grinch’s heart grows three sizes."
11794,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure."
11795,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la."
11796,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"You really didn’t like it, Sheldon?"
11797,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was."
11798,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun."
11799,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account."
11800,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la."
11801,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again.
11802,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,We didn’t have a tree when I was growing up.
11803,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,Really? Why not?
11804,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Mmm, in my family, holidays weren’t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society."
11805,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?"
11806,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other."
11807,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?"
11808,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures."
11809,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,So I take it you don’t want to help us trim the tree.
11810,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.
11811,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,What is it?
11812,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"You’re kidding, right? It’s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton."
11813,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy."
11814,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"Wait, excuse me, but it’s much more Christmassy than anything you’ve put on the tree."
11815,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,Here we go.
11816,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake."
11817,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Merry Newton-mas, everyone."
11818,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"I sense that’s not sincere, although I have no idea why."
11819,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"No, it’s fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane."
11820,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.
11821,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"No, he doesn’t."
11822,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,I understand. You dispute Newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.
11823,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Yeah, you got me. I’m a Leibniz man."
11824,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she’ll talk some sense into you."
11825,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,What? Your… your mother’s coming? When?
11826,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,Tomorrow.
11827,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,When were you going to tell me?
11828,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Um, tomorrow?"
11829,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,Why were you keeping this a secret?
11830,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Well, I just, I thought…"
11831,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate."
11832,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,Why wouldn’t she approve of me? I’m adorable.
11833,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"You are, it’s just…"
11834,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it’s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu."
11835,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Hey, it’s a big menu. There’s two pages just for desserts."
11836,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"I know. And those specials, they change every day."
11837,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Okay, you know what? It’s lame when I say it, it’s just ridiculous when you pile on."
11838,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Okay, sorry."
11839,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,So what did she say when you told her we were going out?
11840,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,Um…
11841,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"You didn’t tell her we were going out, did you?"
11842,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,Um…
11843,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,Why not?
11844,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,Um…
11845,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m no expert on meditation, but if you’re trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om."
11846,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,It was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.
11847,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,No trouble at all.
11848,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"I drove, Mother. I’m driving now."
11849,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Yes, dear. Mommy’s proud. I’ve been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory."
11850,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain’s water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate."
11851,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?"
11852,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
11853,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Oh, did I thank you for the flowers?"
11854,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,You did.
11855,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,I don’t really like flowers.
11856,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"Neither do I, but it’s the social convention."
11857,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"It is, isn’t it?"
11858,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?"
11859,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers."
11860,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"No, I heard that."
11861,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Then what was all that wait, wait, wait about?"
11862,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,I just don’t understand why he knows more about your life than I do.
11863,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Well, I would assume it’s because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect, while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues."
11864,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,It’s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.
11865,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Yes, but we are on the subject, so I’m obliged to ask, Leonard, how are you?"
11866,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Fine, Mom. How are you?"
11867,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Mmm, menopausal."
11868,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,Now I’m less fine.
11869,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,Have you heard your brother has gotten engaged?
11870,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"No. Sheldon, why didn’t you tell me?"
11871,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.
11872,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,She’s a remarkable girl. The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey and a two-time Olympic bronze medallist.
11873,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,You must be very happy.
11874,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Why? I’m not marrying her. So, how about you? Are you seeing anyone interesting?"
11875,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"Well, I’m not sure about interesting, but…"
11876,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Not the time, Sheldon."
11877,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?
11878,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"It’s all right, Sheldon. I will just pretend that Leonard’s not withholding information. Although, I will point out, Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioural tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate."
11879,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"Isn’t she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you."
11880,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"So, Howard, have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage to express your latent homosexual feelings toward one another?"
11881,3,11,the maternal congruence,Howard,What? No.
11882,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,Why not?
11883,3,11,the maternal congruence,Howard,Because we don’t have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.
11884,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,I see.
11885,3,11,the maternal congruence,Howard,"No, really. I have a girlfriend now."
11886,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,And where is she this evening?
11887,3,11,the maternal congruence,Howard,She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.
11888,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,I see. Her grandmother died.
11889,3,11,the maternal congruence,Howard,"Honest to God. Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend."
11890,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,I don’t know what you’re talking about.
11891,3,11,the maternal congruence,Howard,What do you mean you don’t know what I’m talking about? Tell her I have a girlfriend!
11892,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,All right. He “has” a “girlfriend.”
11893,3,11,the maternal congruence,Howard,"Her name is Bernadette, she’s working as a waitress, but she’s going to school to be a microbiologist."
11894,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Howard, keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this construct, the more you’re hurting your partner."
11895,3,11,the maternal congruence,Howard,Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?
11896,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,Hi. Sorry I’m late.
11897,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Oh, glad you’re here, uh, sit down, I’ll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny."
11898,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Oh, yes, the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issues. Has he finally come to terms with his little slugger growing breasts?"
11899,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Well, he sent me a football and a catcher’s mitt for Christmas, so I’m going to say no."
11900,3,11,the maternal congruence,Howard,"If it helps, we’re all good with your breasts."
11901,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Classic overcompensation. Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard, that reminds me, I’m divorcing yours."
11902,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,What?
11903,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,Yes. He was cheating on me.
11904,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,No!
11905,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Yes, with some waitress from the university cafeteria. Can you believe it? A waitress? Oh, no offense, dear."
11906,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"No, it sounded like a compliment."
11907,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,When did this happen?
11908,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Mmm, well, let’s see. Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard’s father?"
11909,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,September 22nd.
11910,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Oh, yes, that’s right. The weekend after Leonard’s dog died."
11911,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,Mitzy’s dead?
11912,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?"
11913,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,I don’t believe this. Why am I the last to know?
11914,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Excuse me, Leonard, I am the one who’s getting a divorce, Mitzy is the one who is dead. Why are you the one making a fuss?"
11915,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"You’re right. I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m sorry, I’m way out of line!"
11916,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"So, Penny, what’s new in your life?"
11917,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,Nothing. Not a damn thing.
11918,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,Thank you for driving me back to my hotel.
11919,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Oh, it’s not a problem."
11920,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don’t want someone like that operating heavy machinery."
11921,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"No, you do not."
11922,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,Your check engine light is on.
11923,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce."
11924,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Oh, not at all. But I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that’s not subjected to regular maintenance."
11925,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Come on, I mean, you’re not upset that your marriage is over?"
11926,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Well, initially I felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger, but that’s the natural reaction of the limbic system to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch."
11927,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Sure, sure."
11928,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Thankfully, my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I haven’t had intercourse with him in eight years."
11929,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,Eight years?
11930,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Oh, that’s nothing. I’ve been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982."
11931,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,Yikes. What’s so funny?
11932,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,That’s exactly what I say during orgasms. Yikes.
11933,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?
11934,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Oh, I don’t drink."
11935,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"I do, I’ll teach you."
11936,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
11937,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,What is it?
11938,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,I made tea.
11939,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,I don’t want tea.
11940,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,I didn’t make tea for you. This is my tea.
11941,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,Then why are you telling me?
11942,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,It’s a conversation starter.
11943,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,That’s a lousy conversation starter.
11944,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"Oh, is it? We’re conversing. Checkmate."
11945,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
11946,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.
11947,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,I want that too. Why are you here?
11948,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"To comfort you, of course. No, that’s not going to work at all, I’ll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you’re experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit."
11949,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Thank you, that’s very comforting."
11950,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,That’s not the comforting part.
11951,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,It’s not?
11952,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you’re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world."
11953,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"You’re right, I do feel better."
11954,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family."
11955,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,You’re my surrogate family?
11956,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,"If it’s any consolation, I’m not happy about it either. Good night."
11957,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Okay, now this time try drinking it all at once."
11958,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,Yikes.
11959,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,I’ve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. Another round for me and my homegirl.
11960,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,I feel a spreading warmth through my extremities.
11961,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"As long as you don’t feel it running down your pants, you’re fine."
11962,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Oh, that is fascinating. I’m noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions. For example, I’m seriously considering asking that busboy to ravish me in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake. What do you think?"
11963,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again."
11964,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Yes. If a little is good, more must be better."
11965,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Hey, Bev, guess what?"
11966,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,What?
11967,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,I’m sleeping with your son.
11968,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,Really? Which one?
11969,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,The one from whom I live across the hall from.
11970,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Well, that’s convenient. How did his penis turn out?"
11971,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Oh, Beverly, I can’t talk to my boyfriend’s mother about his penis."
11972,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Oh, fair enough. What can you tell me, if anything, about that busboy’s penis?"
11973,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Actually, I’ve only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating."
11974,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Really? Well, that means he’s either embarrassed about the relationship or he doesn’t care enough about his mother to tell her he’s in one. Either way, one of us should be insulted."
11975,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Well, let’s go find out who."
11976,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"You go get a taxi. I’m gonna slip my business card into that busboy’s back pocket, cupping his firm, right buttock as I do so."
11977,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,Leonard?
11978,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,Sonny boy!
11979,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!
11980,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,What the hell is going on?
11981,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,You’re in trouble.
11982,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,Why didn’t you tell me you were tapping my homegirl? Did I say that right?
11983,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Yeah, not bad, not bad."
11984,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,Are you guys drunk?
11985,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Well, I hope so. Otherwise, why would we have stopped at Del Taco? Now, how could you not tell me you were in a relationship with this lovely, charming young woman?"
11986,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Oh, thank you."
11987,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"You’re welcome. Is it because she’s uneducated, trapped in a menial service position?"
11988,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,What the hell happened to lovely and charming?
11989,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,How come you didn’t tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn’t tell me you had surgery? How come you didn’t tell me my dog died?
11990,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What I hear you saying is that you want a more intimate mother-son relationship."
11991,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,I do.
11992,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"There. It’s late. Now, go to bed. I’m getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart."
11993,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,That’s the Del Taco.
11994,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?
11995,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Speaking of warm feelings, come here. No, I’d rather have the busboy."
11996,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,Thank you for taking me to the airport.
11997,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,You’re very welcome.
11998,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Once again, I’m driving. I’m right here."
11999,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Please, I am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval. Sheldon, I do hope you’ll forgive me for my inappropriate behaviour last night."
12000,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,I don’t blame you. You were intoxicated.
12001,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,Thank you.
12002,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,I blame Penny.
12003,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"I blame Penny, too. Bad Penny."
12004,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?"
12005,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,I think it’s best that you not know.
12006,3,11,the maternal congruence,Sheldon,Agreed.
12007,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,Agreed.
12008,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"What the hell, agreed."
12009,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,And I want you to take very good care of this young woman.
12010,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Oh, thank you, Beverly."
12011,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"You’re welcome. She doesn’t have much in the way of career prospects, don’t make her responsible for her own orgasms as well."
12012,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,"Mother, remember when I was complaining that you don’t communicate with me enough?"
12013,3,11,the maternal congruence,Beverley,"Yes, dear."
12014,3,11,the maternal congruence,Leonard,I’m over it.
12015,3,11,the maternal congruence,Penny,"Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la la-la."
12016,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they’re our girlfriends.
12017,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,"Yes, actual women are the best."
12018,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,I don’t understand. What other kind of women are there?
12019,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?"
12020,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,"No, it would just freak him out. Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, I’m a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection."
12021,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"What are you trying to tell me, Howard?"
12022,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,"There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I don’t want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too."
12023,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,Don’t worry. We’re planning to have sex right on the salad bar.
12024,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Namaste, white people. Good news! I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen."
12025,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,Got it.
12026,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,Seen it.
12027,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,Detailed analysis posted online.
12028,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Well, then what are we going to do tonight?"
12029,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette."
12030,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,"Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard. These broncos have been saddled."
12031,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,How did we get actual women?
12032,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Great. They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?"
12033,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"It is great, isn’t it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us."
12034,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,We do?
12035,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. I just discovered I don’t have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems."
12036,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,I don’t want to do that.
12037,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"All right. Well, I’m going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems."
12038,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,What about me?
12039,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that."
12040,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Dude, there’s so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it’s a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy’s. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot."
12041,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that’s linked to race riots in the 1940s."
12042,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,Race riots?
12043,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,The zoot suit riots.
12044,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don’t we just go to the galleria and walk around?"
12045,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,I don’t need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?
12046,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,No. We would just walk around and see what’s what.
12047,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,That’s a semantically null sentence.
12048,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be."
12049,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"Well, that’s certainly amusing, but I have no interest."
12050,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let’s go outside. Outside is good."
12051,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?"
12052,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"I don’t know, it’s a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I’m a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff."
12053,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination."
12054,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Oh, boy."
12055,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott’s mathematical fantasy, Flatland."
12056,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,I don’t want to go to Flatland.
12057,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,You’re only saying that because you haven’t been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.
12058,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,Oy.
12059,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"Is that you, Raj? I don’t recognize your edge."
12060,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Sheldon, I’m begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I don’t want to go alone."
12061,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"Well, you’re in luck, there’s a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there’s a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up."
12062,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,What?
12063,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"Tell her you’re a circle, Flatland gals are all hot for circles."
12064,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"I hope you’re hungry, Bernadette, we’re going to a terrific restaurant."
12065,3,12,the psichic vortex,Bernadette,"Oh, yeah, I’m starved. When you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite."
12066,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,"Flesh-eating bacteria. And yet, I still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?"
12067,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,That you’d be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you’d get to second base?
12068,3,12,the psichic vortex,Bernadette,"Oh, we’re way past second base. Right, Howard?"
12069,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,"Well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are."
12070,3,12,the psichic vortex,Bernadette,"How’s your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?"
12071,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,"Well, the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon."
12072,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,Great. How come?
12073,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,"Well, promise you won’t make fun of me."
12074,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"Of course, I would never make fun of you."
12075,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,"Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, I’m going to get a national commercial."
12076,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,Seriously? You’re getting career advice from a psychic?
12077,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,Good job not making fun of her.
12078,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,"She’s not one of those phonies, okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site."
12079,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"Oh, gee, why didn’t you say so? They don’t let just anyone have a Web site."
12080,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,Why are you being such a jerk?
12081,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,You’re surprised? Your psychic didn’t tell you I was going to be a jerk?
12082,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,"Ha-ha, bite me."
12083,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"Come on, Penny."
12084,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,Why don’t you kids go ahead and chat? We’re gonna make out back here.
12085,3,12,the psichic vortex,Bernadette,I’m sliding into third.
12086,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,Thanks for coming with me.
12087,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.
12088,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,Did you really have to bring it in with you?
12089,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?
12090,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Come on, let’s get a drink."
12091,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,I don’t drink.
12092,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. I’ll have a screwdriver, please. Don’t be chintzy with the screw."
12093,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,I would like a root beer float.
12094,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Sheldon, they don’t have ice cream."
12095,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"They don’t? Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party."
12096,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,He’ll have a Shirley Temple.
12097,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,And don’t be chintzy with the Shirley.
12098,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Okay, let’s check out the females."
12099,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,All right. There’s a female.
12100,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"That’s Professor Wilkinson’s wife, she’s like 80 years old."
12101,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,But she’s female. Isn’t that the game?
12102,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,No. I’m looking for a hookup.
12103,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?"
12104,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Not so loud, but ideally, yes. Thanks."
12105,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?
12106,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,You help me run my game.
12107,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,Okay. What is your game?
12108,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree."
12109,3,12,the psichic vortex,Girl,"Hey, that’s pretty cool. What is it?"
12110,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,It’s a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.
12111,3,12,the psichic vortex,Girl,You’re very funny. I’m Abby.
12112,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,I’m Sheldon. How do you do?
12113,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,How do you do? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. Call me Raj.
12114,3,12,the psichic vortex,Abby,"Hi, Raj. Where are you from?"
12115,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,The mysterious subcontinent of India.
12116,3,12,the psichic vortex,Abby,"Ooh, India."
12117,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,You know India?
12118,3,12,the psichic vortex,Abby,I saw Slumdog Millionaire.
12119,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Well, I’m a slumdog astrophysicist."
12120,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I’m sorry.
12121,3,12,the psichic vortex,Abby,"Martha, come here. Meet Raj and Sheldon. This is my friend, Martha."
12122,3,12,the psichic vortex,Martha,Hi.
12123,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,Hello.
12124,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,Hello.
12125,3,12,the psichic vortex,Martha,Is that the limited edition Green Lantern lantern?
12126,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight."
12127,3,12,the psichic vortex,Martha,"Oh, that is so awesome."
12128,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?
12129,3,12,the psichic vortex,Bernadette,"So, what should we talk about?"
12130,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,"Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?"
12131,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,"Oh, we don’t need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car."
12132,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"I’m sorry, but facts are facts."
12133,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,"Right, and if you can’t understand it, it’s not a fact."
12134,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"No, if it’s not a fact, it’s not a fact."
12135,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,"Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me."
12136,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,You’re welcome. How’s your fish?
12137,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,Amazing. Would you like to try some?
12138,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
12139,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,"Well, the fact is, you can’t."
12140,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you’re both scientists. Help me out here."
12141,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,What do you think? Want to jump right into the middle of another couple’s argument?
12142,3,12,the psichic vortex,Bernadette,"No, thank you."
12143,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,Sorry.
12144,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,Maybe we should just stop talking about this.
12145,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.
12146,3,12,the psichic vortex,Waiter,How is everything tonight?
12147,3,12,the psichic vortex,Bernadette,Really uncomfortable.
12148,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"You know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with… Want your fish?"
12149,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"I knew you were going to do that. Doesn’t make me psychic! Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse."
12150,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,What’s going on?
12151,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,We scored. I’m the wingman.
12152,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,Hey.
12153,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,Laser.
12154,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,"Had a great night last night. I don’t like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base."
12155,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,What the hell is eighth base?
12156,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,"Seventh base with shirt off. Well, my shirt. How’d things go with Penny?"
12157,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"Oh, couldn’t be better."
12158,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?
12159,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,It’s not just Cylons. Superman’s next.
12160,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,"All right, I was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but I can come back later when you don’t have a high-powered weapon."
12161,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
12162,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,"Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens."
12163,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,And that didn’t bother you?
12164,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,Au contraire. It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.
12165,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I don’t whenever I’m with Penny?"
12166,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,"Hey, I’m sure Penny fakes all kinds of things when she’s with you."
12167,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here."
12168,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,Let me show you another way to look at this. Here we have the universe of all women. These are the ones you want to sleep with. These are the women who believe exactly what you believe. These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. And right there in the little triple intersection is your ideal mate. Odds are she’s a short physicist with low self-esteem who lives in a government research facility in China.
12169,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"What’s your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can’t do that, Howard."
12170,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,I respect that.
12171,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,What is that?
12172,3,12,the psichic vortex,Howard,Your new girlfriend. Have fun tonight.
12173,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,The dog… koira. The roof… katto. Grapes… ryp leet. One minute. Sis  n.
12174,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,What was that?
12175,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"It means come in. It’s taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I’d learn Finnish."
12176,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"?? ?? ???????? ??? ?????. That’s Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby, and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?"
12177,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,I don’t say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you’ve gone insane.
12178,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,I don’t get it. You had a great time.
12179,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That’s done, I’ve moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I’m not going to learn Finnish again."
12180,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,"Please, Sheldon, I’m a lost Indian boy far from home, and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby, and she’ll only come over if she can bring Martha."
12181,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or… vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider."
12182,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.
12183,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, my. I’ve admired these for years."
12184,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,So does that mean we can go with the girls again?
12185,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!
12186,3,12,the psichic vortex,Raj,You can’t wear the hands on the date.
12187,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,Hulk sad.
12188,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, it’s safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you’re supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you."
12189,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,"Wow, that’s all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?"
12190,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"No, I’m sorry. I really am. It’s not right to mock what a person believes in."
12191,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it’s all about?
12192,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?
12193,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,I would not.
12194,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"Okay, let’s go see your psychic."
12195,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,Really?
12196,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind."
12197,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,You saying I don’t have an open mind?
12198,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff."
12199,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,"You know, I believe in ghosts, too."
12200,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,Great.
12201,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,And astrology.
12202,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals."
12203,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,"Oh, no, no, no, crystals don’t work."
12204,3,12,the psichic vortex,Leonard,"Really, that’s the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?"
12205,3,12,the psichic vortex,Penny,"Oh, voodoo’s real. You don’t want to mess with voodoo."
12206,3,12,the psichic vortex,Martha,Flatland is more than just a mathematical essay. It is also a treatise on Victorian social mores.
12207,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"You know, I had never considered that. Wow, that’s going to completely change my visits there. Well, it’s late."
12208,3,12,the psichic vortex,Martha,Uh-huh.
12209,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,Time for bed.
12210,3,12,the psichic vortex,Martha,Okay.
12211,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"Good night, puny human!"
12212,3,12,the psichic vortex,Martha,Sheldon?
12213,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,Yes?
12214,3,12,the psichic vortex,Martha,"Listen, they’re kind of getting busy in the living room, and I was wondering if I could hang out in here for a while."
12215,3,12,the psichic vortex,Sheldon,"Well, I suppose. Come in. I’ll sleep in Leonard’s room. Good night."
12216,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Howard,"Boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? Just the guys."
12217,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Raj,"Oh, God! Yes, we get it. You have a girlfriend now."
12218,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Howard,"A little jealous, are we?"
12219,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Raj,"No, I’m not jealous. All right, I’d kill a hobo if it’ll get me laid. Now, can we order?"
12220,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu."
12221,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,So what? It’s the same food.
12222,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tso’s Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It’s now under chicken."
12223,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Raj,So?
12224,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Yes, General Tso."
12225,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Raj,"Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?"
12226,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?"
12227,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,It’s obviously a typo.
12228,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant’s now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters."
12229,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Raj,"No, no, no, no, I think it just means it’s the kind of sauce that mobsters like."
12230,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Howard,It doesn’t mean any of that! It’s a typo.
12231,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,You know what? Let’s just get a pizza.
12232,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,Good idea. We’ll go to Corleone’s.
12233,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Howard,"Sure, no mobsters there."
12234,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldn’t possibly contain chunks of mobster."
12235,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,And why is that?
12236,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,It was listed under seafood.
12237,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?
12238,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?"
12239,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,What the…?
12240,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,The TV is gone.
12241,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,So are our laptops.
12242,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Oh God, oh God, oh, God! It’s all right. They didn’t take my comic books."
12243,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"They took our TV, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our PS2, our PS3, our X-Box, our X-Box 360, our classic Nintendo, our Super Nintendo, our Nintendo 64 and our Wii."
12244,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,We like games.
12245,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Right, games. They took Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, Call of Duty 1, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Rock Band, Rock Band 2, Final Fantasy 1 thru 9, The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda  Ocarina of Time, The Legend of Zelda  Twilight Princess, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms. Pacman."
12246,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Policeman,Assorted video games.
12247,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,When does the CSI team get here?
12248,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Policeman,What?
12249,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"In anticipation of their arrival, I’ve bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect."
12250,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,What about me?
12251,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Leonard. It’s too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job."
12252,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?
12253,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Policeman,I’d be happy to put him under a 72-hour psychiatric hold.
12254,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
12255,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Policeman,"We’re done here. Call this number, and we’ll fax you a copy of the report so you can submit it to your insurance company."
12256,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, that’s the end of your inquiry?"
12257,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Policeman,Do you have any more information that might be relevant?
12258,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem."
12259,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,How is that going to help them?
12260,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop."
12261,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Policeman,"Good night, fellas. Come on, Bochco."
12262,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,What are we supposed to do now?
12263,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.
12264,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,Does that mean you’ve ruled me out as a suspect?
12265,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, how I wish I could."
12266,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat.
12267,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"I can’t believe it. If I hadn’t been working the dinner shift, I would’ve run right into the robbers."
12268,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,"Hey, there’s no reason for you to be scared."
12269,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,I’m not scared. I would’ve gone all Nebraska on their asses.
12270,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
12271,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,Hand me the bat.
12272,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?"
12273,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"It won’t happen again, what’s up?"
12274,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.
12275,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,"We’re fine, Sheldon."
12276,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"All right, then. Good night."
12277,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"Good night. That was weird, even for him."
12278,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,Mm-hmm.
12279,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
12280,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,Who is it?
12281,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.
12282,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,Yes?
12283,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,May I come in?
12284,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,Yeah.
12285,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,I see you’re drinking wine.
12286,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,"Yes, we are. And we’re about to go to bed."
12287,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,Uh-huh.
12288,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?"
12289,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don’t think the two of you’d be comfortable on the couch."
12290,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,What do you want?
12291,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"It’s not what I want, it’s what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support."
12292,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,But you don’t like other people.
12293,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,I do tonight. It’s scary over there.
12294,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,"It’s getting scary here, too."
12295,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"Um… three little kittens? Three little pigs? God, I don’t know. Star Wars?"
12296,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,Did we win? Can we go to bed?
12297,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?"
12298,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,"He’s right, Penny. It’s all there."
12299,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you’re feeling insecure, but we’ve really got to go to sleep."
12300,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,All right. I’ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.
12301,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,Great. Good night.
12302,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"Wait, wait, what’s 0400?"
12303,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,4am.
12304,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"That’s, like, in 45 minutes."
12305,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,Just keep walking.
12306,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Woman on TV,It’s quiet out there.
12307,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Man on TV,Maybe a little too quiet.
12308,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Woman on TV,Where are you going?
12309,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Man on TV,Just gonna take a look around outside.
12310,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,Bad idea.
12311,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Woman on TV,"No, Jim, don’t open the door!"
12312,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Listen to her, Jim."
12313,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Man on TV,"Don’t worry, there’s no one out here."
12314,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,Leonard and Penny! Leonard and Penny! Leonard and Penny!
12315,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,Who is it?
12316,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Howard,"All right, we’ve got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system."
12317,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,What if they cut the power?
12318,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Raj,There’s a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.
12319,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,What if someone steals my keys?
12320,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Raj,There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.
12321,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?"
12322,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,I’ll send them a basket of muffins.
12323,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Howard,"Now, inside, we’ve got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software."
12324,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,Where did you get all this stuff?
12325,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Howard,I got a buddy over at the Department of Defence.
12326,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,He just gave it to you?
12327,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Howard,"I’m sure he would have if I had asked. Ironically, their security isn’t all that good."
12328,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"Raj, your car is blocking me… What the hell?"
12329,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,"Sorry, let me help you."
12330,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,Wonderful security system if we’re attacked by a school of tuna.
12331,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Howard,"Don’t worry, the net’s going to be electrified. Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably."
12332,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,Better.
12333,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Sheldon’s journal. Security system in place. However, sleep continues to elude me. I’ve seen the underbelly of Pasadena, this so-called City of Roses, and it haunts me. Ah, the injustice, I lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo."
12334,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, dear. I am the master of my own bladder."
12335,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.
12336,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"Oh, my…"
12337,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,"God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?"
12338,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,I heard a noise.
12339,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,It was us. We knocked over a lamp.
12340,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,Why would you knock over a lamp?
12341,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,We were going to have…
12342,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"He doesn’t need to know what we were doing, Leonard."
12343,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Oh! No, she’s right, I don’t need to know what you were doing. Carry on."
12344,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,What are you doing? Use the door.
12345,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,Good thinking. Perhaps I’ll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.
12346,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,"Great, you do that."
12347,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?
12348,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,I’m lactose intolerant.
12349,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"And you don’t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?"
12350,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"No, thanks."
12351,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss."
12352,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,Sorry about that.
12353,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"Ugh, what can you do? Here."
12354,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.
12355,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"Sheldon, are you okay?"
12356,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,I’m fine. Although I’m no longer the master of my own bladder.
12357,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. I don’t like that.
12358,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,Don’t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?
12359,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, I’m leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that’s overreacting."
12360,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"Come on, Sheldon, you can’t move. Don’t you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?"
12361,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as I’m earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location that’s more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid."
12362,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,Is he quitting his job at the university?
12363,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,"Oh, no, he’s going to telecommute. Everybody’s really excited about it."
12364,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan’l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you’re from Nebraska, correct?"
12365,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,Born and raised.
12366,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail."
12367,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,"Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?"
12368,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"I sense you’re making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there."
12369,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Howard,"Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That’s part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you."
12370,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,I am moving on. I’m going to be a Bozite.
12371,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Leonard,They call themselves Bozites?
12372,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,They should. It’s one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.
12373,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"Sheldon, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m going to miss you."
12374,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Please, Penny, as you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video."
12375,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon on laptop screen,"Greetings. As you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared this short video. The four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance. Though I cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, I am comfortable if you choose to believe that. Since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area, statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again. Live long and prosper."
12376,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Penny,"Sheldon, that’s so…"
12377,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,You might want to lock the door behind me. This isn’t Bozeman.
12378,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Howard,How the hell do I know who’s the friend and who’s the acquaintance?
12379,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"That is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. Lord, is it cold!"
12380,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Man,"Help you with your bags, sir?"
12381,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,"Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town’s Chamber of Commerce. Wait! Wait! Excuse me! One ticket to Pasadena, California, please."
12382,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Howard,"Hey, look who’s back!"
12383,3,13,the bozeman reaction,Sheldon,Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.
12384,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,Whatcha doing?
12385,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,I’m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.
12386,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You’ve been up all night?
12387,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Is it morning?
12388,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,Yes.
12389,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Then I’ve been up all night.
12390,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,And you’re stuck?
12391,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
12392,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can’t help you till I’ve had my coffee."
12393,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Penny, I told you if you don’t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment."
12394,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,What is he doing now?
12395,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Mmm, he’s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off."
12396,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"Captain Hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you’re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight."
12397,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Aye, aye, Captain."
12398,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,I can’t see it! It just won’t coalesce.
12399,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Maybe you need a fresh start.
12400,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"You’re right. It’s a great idea, Leonard. Thank you."
12401,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass…"
12402,3,14,the einstein approximation,Howard,How long has he been stuck?
12403,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.
12404,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.
12405,3,14,the einstein approximation,Howard,Have you tried rebooting him?
12406,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"No, I think it’s a firmware problem."
12407,3,14,the einstein approximation,Raj,"Hey, it’s Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink in Glendale tonight. Who’s up for getting down?"
12408,3,14,the einstein approximation,Howard,"Oh, that’s perfect. Bernadette’s been hocking me to take her roller skating."
12409,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.
12410,3,14,the einstein approximation,Howard,What could be better? We’re in.
12411,3,14,the einstein approximation,Raj,Great. It’s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.
12412,3,14,the einstein approximation,Howard,You can come with us.
12413,3,14,the einstein approximation,Raj,"No, it’s okay. I don’t have to go. I’m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I’m a walking brown Yelp.com."
12414,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"Structure, constant structure. One atom…"
12415,3,14,the einstein approximation,Howard,"Boy, he’s really gone, isn’t he?"
12416,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant."
12417,3,14,the einstein approximation,Howard,I thought I smelled popcorn.
12418,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it’s always hexagonal…"
12419,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,I haven’t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.
12420,3,14,the einstein approximation,Raj,"Hey, those are my lima beans!"
12421,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"Not lima beans, carbon atoms."
12422,3,14,the einstein approximation,Raj,"But if I don’t eat my lima beans, I can’t have my cookie."
12423,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Here, you want my peas?"
12424,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons."
12425,3,14,the einstein approximation,Howard,Want my corn?
12426,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Don’t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?
12427,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?"
12428,3,14,the einstein approximation,Howard,Good. P.F. Chang’s? My mom has coupons.
12429,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Great. Your mom’s not coming, right?"
12430,3,14,the einstein approximation,Howard,"Not this time, I promise."
12431,3,14,the einstein approximation,Raj,"Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I’m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes."
12432,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,The plural of coccyx is coccyges.
12433,3,14,the einstein approximation,Raj,Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.
12434,3,14,the einstein approximation,Bernadette,"Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?"
12435,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,Not recently.
12436,3,14,the einstein approximation,Bernadette,"I don’t know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing."
12437,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them."
12438,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"You had some nice moves out there, Howard."
12439,3,14,the einstein approximation,Howard,"Thanks. You, too."
12440,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?
12441,3,14,the einstein approximation,Howard,Not really. I was in my boogie zone.
12442,3,14,the einstein approximation,Bernadette,When Howard tried to do the splits…
12443,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,Shh.
12444,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Sorry. I’m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.
12445,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"Oh, poor baby."
12446,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Don’t tell Koothrappali. After you.
12447,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon."
12448,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Oh, my God! Are you…"
12449,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Good Lord! You’re ruining everything!
12450,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"Oh, damn."
12451,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Are you okay?
12452,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,Do I look okay?
12453,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Don’t bark at me. I fell, too."
12454,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"Oh, you’ve been falling all night. You’re used to it."
12455,3,14,the einstein approximation,Howard,"Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?"
12456,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,The same thing I’ve been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.
12457,3,14,the einstein approximation,Bernadette,With marbles?
12458,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn’t I?"
12459,3,14,the einstein approximation,Bernadette,"Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?"
12460,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"I don’t know, two, three days. Not important. I don’t need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth."
12461,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?
12462,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"No, that’s a crazy thing."
12463,3,14,the einstein approximation,Bernadette,"Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don’t get enough REM sleep?"
12464,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.
12465,3,14,the einstein approximation,Bernadette,Which leads to…?
12466,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Impaired cognitive function.
12467,3,14,the einstein approximation,Bernadette,"Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed."
12468,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,But I don’t want to go to bed.
12469,3,14,the einstein approximation,Bernadette,I’m going to count to three. One…
12470,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"Oh, all right."
12471,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,That was amazing how you handled him.
12472,3,14,the einstein approximation,Bernadette,I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.
12473,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"Leonard, you’re… you’re giggling in your sleep."
12474,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"It’s not me, it’s my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman."
12475,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"Well, it creeps me out."
12476,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it."
12477,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,Just answer the phone.
12478,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Hello. Yeah, I’m Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he’s my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I’ll be right there."
12479,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,What happened?
12480,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Sheldon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village.
12481,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,Okay. Have fun.
12482,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Hi. I’m Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?
12483,3,14,the einstein approximation,Security Guard,Ball pit.
12484,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Thanks for not calling the cops.
12485,3,14,the einstein approximation,Security Guard,"Oh, hey, it’s no big deal. My sister’s got a kid who’s special."
12486,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, well, he’s extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?"
12487,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn’t visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.
12488,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?"
12489,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child’s play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms."
12490,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"No, I don’t think so. We need to go home now."
12491,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,But I’m still working.
12492,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"If you don’t come out of there, I’m going to have to drag you out."
12493,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"You can try, but you’ll never catch me."
12494,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"For God’s sakes. Sheldon, come here!"
12495,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Bazinga.
12496,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Bazinga.
12497,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Bazinga.
12498,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Bazinga.
12499,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Bazinga.
12500,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"What! What, what, what?"
12501,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,What?
12502,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,I have good news.
12503,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
12504,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Your cell phone was off.
12505,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Because we didn’t want to be disturbed.
12506,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"And that didn’t work out, did it?"
12507,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"Sheldon, what do you want?"
12508,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,I came to tell you I’ve got the answer.
12509,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Really? You figured out the graphene problem?
12510,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"No, no, I’m still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out."
12511,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We’re going to have to break up."
12512,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,What are you talking about?
12513,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,Oh.
12514,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Einstein.
12515,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, I’m going to need a little more."
12516,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Albert Einstein.
12517,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Keep going.
12518,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office."
12519,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"So, you’re going to go work at the patent office?"
12520,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"Don’t be absurd. That’s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem."
12521,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Sounds like a great plan.
12522,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.
12523,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night."
12524,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"You’re welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you’re on your back."
12525,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,Leonard doesn’t snore.
12526,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"No, I wasn’t talking to Leonard."
12527,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Told you.
12528,3,14,the einstein approximation,Employment Office Assistant,"So, Mr. Cooper, you’re looking for a job."
12529,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,A menial job. Like yours.
12530,3,14,the einstein approximation,Assistant,"Why, thank you for noticing. I’m Menial Employee of the Month. Do you have a particular field in mind?"
12531,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?"
12532,3,14,the einstein approximation,Assistant,No.
12533,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Shouldn’t you check your database?
12534,3,14,the einstein approximation,Assistant,No.
12535,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,You didn’t really type.
12536,3,14,the einstein approximation,Assistant,"I didn’t really have to. So, how about construction?"
12537,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis."
12538,3,14,the einstein approximation,Assistant,"No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead."
12539,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,I could do that.
12540,3,14,the einstein approximation,Assistant,Good.
12541,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,One question.
12542,3,14,the einstein approximation,Assistant,Yes?
12543,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,What’s sheetrock?
12544,3,14,the einstein approximation,Assistant,Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?
12545,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,That seems acceptable.
12546,3,14,the einstein approximation,Assistant,Do you have your own car?
12547,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,I don’t drive.
12548,3,14,the einstein approximation,Assistant,"Of course you don’t. Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question. What was your last job?"
12549,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman’s terms, string theory."
12550,3,14,the einstein approximation,Assistant,I see. Just give me a second. Security!
12551,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"Okay, I’ll get those drinks started for you."
12552,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Behind you.
12553,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?"
12554,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,I’m trying to get these tables cleared. We’re slammed.
12555,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?"
12556,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don’t like touching other people’s coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am."
12557,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?"
12558,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"Oh, heavens, no. Since I don’t need to be paid, I didn’t need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way."
12559,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"Sheldon, this is ridiculous."
12560,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check."
12561,3,14,the einstein approximation,Bernadette,"Thanks, Sheldon."
12562,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"Sheldon, wait, this isn’t even what I do. I’m a waitress, not a busboy."
12563,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"You’re right. That is more menial. Hello, I’m Sheldon. I’ll be your server today. I don’t recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen."
12564,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,"All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, here’s your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It’s a little unconventional, but I think you’ll like it. It’s zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon appétit."
12565,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?"
12566,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Yes.
12567,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Double guacamole?
12568,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Of course.
12569,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,No cilantro?
12570,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Nope.
12571,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Lettuce shredded, not chopped?"
12572,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Yep.
12573,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,You understand why I’m doing this to you?
12574,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,I do.
12575,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,That’ll be all. That was fun.
12576,3,14,the einstein approximation,Raj,How long can he keep this up?
12577,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer."
12578,3,14,the einstein approximation,Raj,He never went back to the university?
12579,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg’s shih tzu.
12580,3,14,the einstein approximation,Raj,Sheesh.
12581,3,14,the einstein approximation,Howard,"I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van."
12582,3,14,the einstein approximation,Raj,But he’s afraid of dogs.
12583,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, that’s the only thing wrong with that plan."
12584,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. What’s this?"
12585,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,Sheldon took our order.
12586,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,Sheldon doesn’t work here.
12587,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn’t either."
12588,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I’ve been looking at it all wrong. I can’t consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It’s a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.
12589,3,14,the einstein approximation,Penny,"Sheldon, where are you going? Aren’t you going to clean this up?"
12590,3,14,the einstein approximation,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I don’t work here.
12591,3,14,the einstein approximation,Howard,Happy now?
12592,3,14,the einstein approximation,Raj,I’m on a cloud. Swing me.
12593,3,14,the einstein approximation,Leonard,"Sheldon, come here."
12594,3,15,the large hadron collision,Howard,"Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie. Listen, I got to go, but I’ll see you tonight? Okay. Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye. No, you hang up first. Hello?"
12595,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,"Dude, I’m glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don’t?"
12596,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Actually, he might have to. There’s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it’s not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener."
12597,3,15,the large hadron collision,Howard,That’s not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.
12598,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,Thank you.
12599,3,15,the large hadron collision,Howard,"Although, I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a little bit of a perk."
12600,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Who’s miserable and alone?
12601,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,Me.
12602,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.
12603,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener."
12604,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine’s Day?"
12605,3,15,the large hadron collision,Howard,"Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. There’s a $39.95 lover’s special at P.F. Chang’s. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front."
12606,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn’t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one’s steady gal to witness a brutal murder?"
12607,3,15,the large hadron collision,Howard,"I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food."
12608,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,"Well, if anyone’s interested, I’ll be spending this Valentine’s Day the same way I spend every Valentine’s Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal."
12609,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Okay, so to sum up  one giant marble horse, one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken. And let’s see, who’s left? Oh, that’s right. My plans. Isn’t anyone going to ask?"
12610,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,"Fine, tell us you’re going to have sex with Penny."
12611,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,That’s not what I was going to tell you.
12612,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,It’s okay. I don’t mind hearing about your sex life. It’s his that bugs me.
12613,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?
12614,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasn’t published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize."
12615,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Actually, Professor Norton can’t make it. He threw his back out rock climbing."
12616,3,15,the large hadron collision,Howard,I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.
12617,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?
12618,3,15,the large hadron collision,Howard,That’s the one.
12619,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"In any case, they’re asking me to fill in for him."
12620,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?
12621,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!
12622,3,15,the large hadron collision,Howard,"Oh, man!"
12623,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,"No way, dude!"
12624,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"This is incredible! I’m so happy, I’m not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I’m just going to run home and start packing."
12625,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,Why wouldn’t you take Penny?
12626,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,I am taking Penny.
12627,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,"Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home."
12628,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Sheldon, you got a minute?"
12629,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says après supercollider?"
12630,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m not taking you to Switzerland."
12631,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?"
12632,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Penny.
12633,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,What? That’s absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
12634,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Yes, but it’ll be Valentine’s Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps."
12635,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
12636,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"I’m sorry, Sheldon."
12637,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,Sorry? I’ve been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.
12638,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Yeah, well, I’ve been dreaming about spending Valentine’s Day with a girl since I was six."
12639,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,Shame on you! That’s no dream for a scientist!
12640,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"Okay, what’s the big surprise?"
12641,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine’s Day.
12642,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"Oh. Wow. Okay. Let’s see. We’ve got, uh, milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then I’m going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?"
12643,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"No. But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa."
12644,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"Okay, I’m starting to think Swiss is key here."
12645,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Uh-huh.
12646,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,We’re going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?
12647,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,How does that involve air travel?
12648,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,We’re going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?
12649,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,No.
12650,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"Okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but I’m over it."
12651,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,We’re going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We’ll also go skiing.
12652,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,We’re going skiing in Switzerland?!
12653,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Well, you’ll ski, I’ll fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine’s Day."
12654,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"Oh, my God, Leonard! That’s incredible!"
12655,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny."
12656,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,My Rabe-what-ly?
12657,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall, and B, you will not be going to Switzerland."
12658,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Sheldon, we’ve been through this. I’m taking Penny."
12659,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,Afraid not. Do you recognize this?
12660,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Not the roommate agreement.
12661,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him."
12662,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Oh, for God’s sakes."
12663,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,You actually put that in an agreement?
12664,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie."
12665,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"He can’t kill me, even if I turn."
12666,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?
12667,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"No, that seemed a little farfetched."
12668,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?"
12669,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"I’ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don’t care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing."
12670,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"Okay, I know I shouldn’t ask, but what is…?"
12671,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,No.
12672,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,I’d be much further along if I’d been allowed to practice.
12673,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Look, Sheldon, I know it’s in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I’ll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland."
12674,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,Is that your final decision?
12675,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,It is.
12676,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,Very well.
12677,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"It’s not over, is it?"
12678,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,What do you think?
12679,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? Think it’s gonna rain? Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay, I know what’ll cheer you up, let’s play one of your driving games."
12680,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter."
12681,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?
12682,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,You’re right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.
12683,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon. Can’t you at least try to understand how much this means to me?"
12684,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch."
12685,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Rupert Murdoch?
12686,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2."
12687,3,15,the large hadron collision,Howard,I’m sorry I couldn’t hang with you last night. I had a date with Bernadette.
12688,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,I know. I saw the Tweet.
12689,3,15,the large hadron collision,Howard,"So, what did you end up doing?"
12690,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.
12691,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,You seen Sheldon?
12692,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?
12693,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?"
12694,3,15,the large hadron collision,Howard,I’d take Sheldon to Switzerland.
12695,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Seriously?
12696,3,15,the large hadron collision,Howard,Absolutely. And I’d leave him there.
12697,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,What the hell is that?
12698,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Uh, let’s see. Yup, 30 pieces of silverware."
12699,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Morning, old chum."
12700,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,What’s going on?
12701,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"I’ve made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here’s Frodo."
12702,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,You made Frodo pancakes?
12703,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy."
12704,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Why are you doing this?
12705,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,It’s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I’ve had some time to reflect and I’ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It’s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?
12706,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Thanks. It’s good.
12707,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"What you’re tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you’ve finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary."
12708,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,You hate Babylon 5.
12709,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it’s hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you’re my friend."
12710,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland."
12711,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,Drat. No Frodo for you.
12712,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,Hello.
12713,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,Hello.
12714,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Alright, let’s dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I’m here."
12715,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords."
12716,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I’m here in the laundry room."
12717,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,Better acoustics for your throat singing?
12718,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"It’s actually not bad. But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD."
12719,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"Oh, for God’s sakes."
12720,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind’s understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.
12721,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,I’m sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?
12722,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let’s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination."
12723,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"Okay, show’s over."
12724,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"No, it’s not. I’ve got five more slides."
12725,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"Sheldon, this is Leonard’s decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go."
12726,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,Very well. Enjoy yourself. You’re going to be in the presence of something that I’ve dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you’ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.
12727,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,I’ll talk to Leonard.
12728,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,You will?
12729,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go."
12730,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, thank you!"
12731,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,You’re welcome.
12732,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Since I rarely hug, I’m relying on your expertise regarding duration."
12733,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,I think we’re there.
12734,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Oh, good. Bye-bye."
12735,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,"You know what? Even though I don’t have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentine’s Day."
12736,3,15,the large hadron collision,Howard,"Trust me, you can’t. I’ve tried."
12737,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,"No, no, no, I’m going to have a me day. First I’m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then I’m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies."
12738,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Sheldon, I need to talk to you."
12739,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermus?"
12740,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Some what?
12741,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,Cholermus. It’s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I’m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.
12742,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,You’re not going to Switzerland!
12743,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Oh, but I am. Didn’t Penny tell you the good news?"
12744,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.
12745,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Yes, that good news."
12746,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it’s Penny, not you!"
12747,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation."
12748,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,I don’t need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!
12749,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,That’s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?
12750,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you."
12751,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,Really?
12752,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Yeah, really."
12753,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends."
12754,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,I’m sorry you feel that way.
12755,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"I don’t think you’re fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard."
12756,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Why don’t you enlighten me?
12757,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates’ house should I be invited.
12758,3,15,the large hadron collision,Howard,"Ooh, that’s gotta sting."
12759,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Just think, this time tomorrow we’ll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine’s Day."
12760,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.
12761,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Thermal? ‘Cause it’s gonna be cold.
12762,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"Think it through, Leonard."
12763,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Oh!
12764,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,Oh!
12765,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Gesundheit. Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit. You getting a cold?"
12766,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"No, no, it’s probably just allergies."
12767,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Do you want an allergy pill? ‘Cause I have ’em all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental."
12768,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,Do any of them work?
12769,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Not really, I’m just an enthusiast."
12770,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,Penny? You okay?
12771,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!
12772,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,What’s going on?
12773,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,I’m having a tea party. What do you think’s going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.
12774,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you’ll feel better by then?"
12775,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,Yep. ‘Cause I’m gonna be dead.
12776,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and she’s not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you’re still interested, you’re welcome to come."
12777,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Great. I’ll start packing. In a minute. Oh, look, it’s the cholermus."
12778,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,Here’s your soup.
12779,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,Chicken?
12780,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,Yes.
12781,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,With the little stars?
12782,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,Yes.
12783,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,Heated to 180 degrees?
12784,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"Why don’t I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me."
12785,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,You don’t have to be mean. I’m sick.
12786,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"Yeah, well, I’m sick, too."
12787,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,"Not my problem. I just don’t understand how this happened to me. I’m scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle."
12788,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,"I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon."
12789,3,15,the large hadron collision,Sheldon,It’s you! I touched you!
12790,3,15,the large hadron collision,Penny,Happy Valentine’s Day.
12791,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,"Oh, my goodness, look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh, and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever."
12792,3,15,the large hadron collision,Leonard,"Yeah, I forgot about all this."
12793,3,15,the large hadron collision,Raj,But I never will.
12794,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,Will you please turn your shirt off?
12795,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Raj,What? I’m giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I’m awesome and to be feared.
12796,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,"Yeah, right, there’s nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who’s got music blasting from between his nipples."
12797,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,"Hey, Stuart, what’s going on?"
12798,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,"Well, you might want to mark your Google calendars. Stan Lee is coming to do a signing on Thursday."
12799,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? I’m sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.
12800,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,"No, just a regular comic signing. My uncle is his dermatologist and Stan’s doing him a favour."
12801,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Oh, I don’t want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?"
12802,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.
12803,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Well, look who thinks he’s Stuart’s uncle now."
12804,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Raj,Can’t believe it. We’re going to meet Stan Lee!
12805,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,I’m sad to say I taught him those moves.
12806,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,"I can’t decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom. Alex, I’m going to go with what is… you’re a dumbass?"
12807,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,I’ve decided I’m going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month’s Batman.
12808,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,That’s crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.
12809,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom."
12810,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Raj,"That’s a great idea, I’m going to get him to sign a Batman as well."
12811,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,What is it about the word unique you don’t understand?
12812,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,"Ow! Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut."
12813,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Raj,"Well, obviously you don’t remember your circumcision."
12814,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,There’s Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.
12815,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,Why don’t you keep that stuff in the bathroom?
12816,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.
12817,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine."
12818,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Hi!
12819,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,Hey. Guess who’s going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?
12820,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Um, can you give me a hint?"
12821,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,Stan Lee.
12822,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Um, Stanley, Stanley, Stanley Tucci?"
12823,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,"No, no, Stan Lee."
12824,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Oh, oh, Stan Lee! Cool!"
12825,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,"You have no idea who he is, do you?"
12826,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Of course I do. You’re an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in.
12827,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,"Good, good, so, who’s Stan Lee?"
12828,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Um, he was on Star Trek."
12829,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,Nope.
12830,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Star Wars?
12831,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,No.
12832,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Um, uh, Stan Lee, oh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?"
12833,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,That’s Bruce Lee.
12834,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Oh. So, is this Bruce Lee’s nerdy brother, Stan?"
12835,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,"Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?"
12836,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,Because most of the things I’m planning to buy haven’t been invented yet.
12837,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don’t you put it in the bank?
12838,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"I don’t trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge."
12839,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,You’ve also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court.
12840,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it’s supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena."
12841,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,I’m sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?
12842,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,It bothers me.
12843,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,"Sheldon, this is a summons."
12844,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,A summons for what?
12845,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,Looks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue at 9 30 p.m. on November 16. They got you on a traffic camera. Nice picture.
12846,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"November 16? Penny, that’s the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room."
12847,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"No, it isn’t."
12848,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Yes, it is."
12849,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"No, it isn’t."
12850,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Penny, I have an eidetic memory. Also, that’s a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder."
12851,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Mmm, no, it isn’t."
12852,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?"
12853,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Okay, look, they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn’t driving and they were all, if it wasn’t you, who was it?"
12854,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,So you betrayed me?
12855,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,No! It wasn’t a betrayal. It was more of a can’t afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.
12856,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.
12857,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day."
12858,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,It’s not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.
12859,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,I’m not going to pay a fine. That would imply I’m guilty.
12860,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,You are guilty. That one I liked.
12861,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"I am not guilty. I only have a learner’s permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went."
12862,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Sheldon, I’m sorry. I’ll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series."
12863,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"You don’t need to reimburse me because I’m not paying. On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, I’m going to begin preparing my defence right now."
12864,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,"Okay, he’s going to jail."
12865,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,"Oh, that’s right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day."
12866,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Now you see what you’ve done? Because of you, we’re all going to miss Stan Lee."
12867,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,Whoa! What do you mean all?
12868,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Well, you’re my friends. You’ll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I’m victorious."
12869,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,"Yeah, okay. No."
12870,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?
12871,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,That’s what I’m saying.
12872,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,Howard?
12873,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,"Wow. Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court? Uh, if this was Sophie’s Choice it would’ve been a much shorter movie. No."
12874,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Raj? You’ll be there, won’t you? All right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me. So, I guess it’ll just be me and my eyewitness."
12875,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Oh, balls."
12876,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,Please try to wear something appropriate. It won’t help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks.
12877,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,Penny. Penny. Penny.
12878,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,That’s just wrong.
12879,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"All right, let’s go."
12880,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse, I’d like to call on your skills as an actress."
12881,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,What is this?
12882,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"I’ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let’s face it, you’re somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, don’t worry, it’s written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?"
12883,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Do I have a choice?
12884,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?"
12885,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Darn tootin’, I do, if the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase."
12886,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,Excellent. Go on.
12887,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I’ve ever seen in, like, ever."
12888,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,And who performed that heroic act?
12889,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you."
12890,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"There’s no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts."
12891,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,But it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?
12892,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.
12893,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,But it is a fact that it’s a privilege to know you. Totally.
12894,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.
12895,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Judge,Pay the cashier. Sheldon Cooper?
12896,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Good morning, Your Honour. Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se. That is to say, representing himself."
12897,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Judge,I know what it means. I went to law school.
12898,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"And yet you wound up in traffic court. Anyway, if it would please the court, I’d like to begin with an opening statement."
12899,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Judge,"The court would advise you to make it quick, as the court had a dicey-looking breakfast burrito this morning and just took an Imodium."
12900,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I’m unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete."
12901,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Judge,Impressive.
12902,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,Thank you.
12903,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Judge,Guilty. Pay the cashier.
12904,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,I object. You’re completely ignoring the law.
12905,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Judge,"No, I’m following the law. I’m ignoring you."
12906,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours."
12907,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Judge,"Dr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt and throw you in jail, I’m going to give you a chance to apologize for that last remark."
12908,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth.
12909,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,That’s my spot.
12910,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Raj,I can’t wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.
12911,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,"Oh, come on, why would you do that?"
12912,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Raj,"Bruce Banner, Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Stephen Strange, Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer, Peter Parker, oh, and worst of all, J. Jonah Jameson, Jr."
12913,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,"Okay, I’m cutting. I’m not gonna talk to Stan Lee after you cheese him off."
12914,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,Hey.
12915,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Sheldon’s in jail.
12916,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,Sheldon’s in jail?
12917,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Raj,You called it.
12918,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,For what?
12919,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"What do you think? For doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge. He has to stay in there until he apologizes."
12920,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,So tell him to apologize.
12921,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard. That didn’t occur to me. If he doesn’t apologize by 5 o’clock he is going to spend the night in jail."
12922,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,"Oh, no, that’s terrible. Ooh, the line’s moving. Got to go. Bye."
12923,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Excuse me? Excuse me, jailor?"
12924,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Guard,What?
12925,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,I need to use the restroom.
12926,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Guard,Knock yourself out.
12927,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,That’s the toilet?
12928,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Guard,"Well, it ain’t a wishing well."
12929,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,Please tell the judge I’m ready to apologize.
12930,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,"Look at that. To my friend, Leonard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!"
12931,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,"Awesome. Mine says, To my friend, Howard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!"
12932,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Raj,"Mine says, To Raj, from Stan Lee."
12933,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,That’s ’cause you pissed him off about his character names.
12934,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Raj,"Hey, I didn’t even mention Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock, Pepper Potts, Victor Von Doom, oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model."
12935,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,We’re home.
12936,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,"Oh, hey, buddy. How’d it go?"
12937,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,You know very well how it went.
12938,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,"Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you."
12939,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,I was found guilty and fined $533.
12940,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"I’m going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others."
12941,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"I also now have three points on a driver’s licence I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals."
12942,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,"Plus, you didn’t get to meet Stan Lee."
12943,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,"Okay, that’s enough, Howard. The poor guy’s had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit."
12944,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,"You’re right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, Stan Lee took Stuart and us out for gelato."
12945,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,You had gelato with Stan Lee?
12946,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,He said we could call him Stan.
12947,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Leonard,Except for Raj.
12948,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Well, I hope you’re satisfied, Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today."
12949,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Okay, I realize that…"
12950,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee."
12951,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Okay, maybe you’ll have another chance to have…"
12952,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!"
12953,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Did he just somehow give me the finger?
12954,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,Not just the finger. The moving finger.
12955,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Hey, Stuart."
12956,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,"Oh, hey, Penny. Wow. Hi."
12957,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,What’s going on?
12958,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,Nothing. I’m just getting ready to close up and head out.
12959,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Ah. Cool. Got any fun plans?
12960,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,"Oh, yeah. Big night tonight. Gonna share a can of tuna with the cat."
12961,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Oh, nice."
12962,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,Not even my cat. I just feed it. Some nights it doesn’t even show up.
12963,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um, you could do me a favour."
12964,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,"Sure, yeah, name it."
12965,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Well, I’m kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee, and I really want to make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet."
12966,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,"Oh, I’m sorry, I don’t have his phone number."
12967,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Hmm. Damn. All right. Thank you.
12968,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,Mm-hmm. Wait. I have his address.
12969,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Really? Great!
12970,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,But I can’t give it to you.
12971,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Then why did you tell me you had it?
12972,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,I don’t know. Just chatting. You’re looking at a guy who could very well get stood up by a stray cat tonight.
12973,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"I’m sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway."
12974,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,Mm-hmm. Wait.
12975,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Yeah?
12976,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,Maybe we can make a deal.
12977,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,What kind of deal?
12978,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,I will give you the address if you go to my cousin’s wedding with me.
12979,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,You’re extorting a date out of me?
12980,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,I kind of have to. The cousin who’s getting married is the cousin I usually go to weddings with.
12981,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Can I bring Leonard?
12982,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,Sure. What the hell.
12983,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Deal.
12984,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stuart,We’ll tell people he’s your cousin.
12985,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"This is Stan Lee’s front door. We were on Stan Lee’s curb, then we were on Stan Lee’s walk, and now we’re at Stan Lee’s front door."
12986,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Yup.
12987,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee’s doorbell. At Stan Lee’s house. We’re about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee."
12988,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Okay, sweetie, I don’t know if we’re gonna have cookies, or he’s just gonna say hi, or really what’s gonna happen, so just let me talk, and we’ll…"
12989,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stan Lee,Yeah?
12990,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Are you Stan Lee?
12991,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stan Lee,"Oh, damn."
12992,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Hi. I’m Penny. This is my friend, Sheldon."
12993,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,We’re not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes.
12994,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Right, right. Anyway, Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours, and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store, but he kind of ended up in jail."
12995,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stan Lee,I see. And you thought you’d just come over to my house uninvited?
12996,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,You said we were invited.
12997,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,"Oh, no, no, I said I’m inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee’s house."
12998,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stan Lee,"You know, you fan boys are unbelievable. Do you think you can just ring my doorbell any time you want? I mean, why don’t you just come on in and watch the Lakers game with me?"
12999,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Well, I’m not much of a sports fan, but thank you."
13000,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,I’m sorry. He doesn’t really understand sarcasm.
13001,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Stan Lee,"Well, I’ll give him something he’ll understand. Joanie, call the police!"
13002,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Penny,Nice to meet you.
13003,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Raj,"Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Invincible Iron Man, Happy Hogan, Curt Connors…"
13004,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,Would you just let it go?
13005,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Raj,"And worst of all, Fin Fang Foom."
13006,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"I’ll tell you where I’ve been. You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics, but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order."
13007,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Howard,Sweet.
13008,3,16,the excelsior acquisition,Sheldon,"Plus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing. This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy."
13009,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?
13010,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"Well, it’s very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I’m the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle."
13011,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"One more floor, and I’d be the pulled muscle."
13012,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,"Oh, it’s about time, I’m starving."
13013,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"Uh, well, we didn’t actually get Chinese food."
13014,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,Why not?
13015,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"Don’t panic, this is better."
13016,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,"Oh, no, you didn’t trade the food for magic beans, did you?"
13017,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city."
13018,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,"Yeah, sometimes I don’t listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down."
13019,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him."
13020,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,Who’s Adam West?
13021,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"Who’s Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?"
13022,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"My guess is, “Hey, four minutes! New record!” That’s why I’m the funny one."
13023,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff."
13024,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,They were closing up. We got this whole box for sixty bucks.
13025,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,We didn’t even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.
13026,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,There a new girlfriend in there? ‘Cause you might need one.
13027,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains! Oh, you’re right, it’s Ghostbusters 2. Never mind."
13028,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"Oh, my God. An Alf doll. When I was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac, and Alf was going to bring him back to me. But he never did. Where’s my daddy, puppet? Where is he?"
13029,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,That is so sad.
13030,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"No, what’s sad is that you don’t know Adam West was TV’s Batman."
13031,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"Here’s Spock’s head with no body. Here’s Mr. T’s body with no head. Oh, yeah, here’s Spock’s body with Mr. T’s head. I pity the fool who’s illogical."
13032,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,"Okay, I’m just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony."
13033,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"Okay, bye."
13034,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,Okay.
13035,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots."
13036,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,And an Aquaman action figure.
13037,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,Looks like someone drew a penis on him.
13038,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,Huh? That’ll come off.
13039,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,You see what you’re doing? Stop that.
13040,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,Fascinating.
13041,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,What?
13042,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.
13043,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,Oh.
13044,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,It’s even got the Elvish engraving on it.
13045,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,It’s not Elvish. It’s the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to rule them all.
13046,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,One Ring to find them.
13047,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,One Ring to bring them all.
13048,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,And in the darkness bind them.
13049,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"Holy crap, are we nerdy."
13050,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"So, I was doing some checking on the ring."
13051,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?"
13052,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"Yes, there is. Oh, here’s a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape."
13053,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"No, that’s okay. I’ll get it."
13054,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. No copyright notice on it. So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world."
13055,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,Seedy underbelly?
13056,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"You know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties, that kind of stuff."
13057,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,Who’s this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?
13058,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,Just a guy. I know a guy.
13059,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,Is it Eddie Crispo?
13060,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"No, I can’t tell you who it is. Stop asking."
13061,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.
13062,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"I know lots of dangerous people, okay?"
13063,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,Name one.
13064,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"Eddie Crispo. Anyway, he said this isn’t a replica. It’s the real deal."
13065,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"If you’re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement."
13066,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"He’s not saying it’s a magic ring. You’re not, are you?"
13067,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"No, but it’s close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring."
13068,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,Mine!
13069,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together."
13070,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure."
13071,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,How is this maritime salvage?
13072,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"Other than the lack of water, how is it not?"
13073,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?"
13074,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"Well, it’s tough to say since it’s hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures…"
13075,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,Your guy Eddie Crispo?
13076,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"Yes. He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand."
13077,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"Okay, that’s a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski."
13078,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,Why do you want a jet ski?
13079,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can’t just be a coincidence.
13080,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"We can’t sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies."
13081,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,It’s sad how great that sounds.
13082,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"Guys, it’s stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him."
13083,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.
13084,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,There are no Jewish hobbits.
13085,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"Clearly, you’ve never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah."
13086,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"We are not blackmailing Peter J… All right, where’s the ring?"
13087,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,You mean my ring?
13088,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,What are you doing?
13089,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did."
13090,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,Give me that.
13091,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"Look, let’s be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski."
13092,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,I found it. The ring is mine. I don’t understand why in this group I never get my way.
13093,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,You always get your way.
13094,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,I’ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.
13095,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,"Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?"
13096,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s delicious, the sarcasm’s a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it."
13097,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,What ring?
13098,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,This ring.
13099,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,Looking for something?
13100,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?
13101,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,Why?
13102,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"It’s a prop from a movie, and we’re kind of fighting over it."
13103,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,"Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don’t even get to keep it?"
13104,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you’d have my great Aunt Ida’s brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat."
13105,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,How am I looking now?
13106,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,Ow! You hit me! I’m bleeding!
13107,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,What was that?
13108,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.
13109,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,That’s my girl.
13110,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"So, Sheldon, how’s it feel to get beaten up by a girl?"
13111,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"It’s not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only I’d had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then I’d have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter."
13112,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?"
13113,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,No.
13114,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,I was afraid of that. Go ahead.
13115,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Man on Screen,"Greetings from Mumbai. I am Raj’s attorney, Venkatesh Koothrappali."
13116,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,Also my cousin.
13117,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,You brought a lawyer?
13118,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Venkatesh,Don’t answer that. I’ll get straight to the point. My client’s prepared to surrender any interest he has in the ring in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.
13119,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,We’re not giving him two Jet Skis.
13120,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Venkatesh,"Look, we’re big boys, why don’t we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle? One Kawasaki Jet Ski, done and done."
13121,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,No Jet Skis.
13122,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Venkatesh,"All right, forget the Jet Skis."
13123,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to “tear them a new one?”
13124,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Venkatesh,What can I say? They played hardball. We lost.
13125,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,You’re useless.
13126,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Venkatesh,I told you that when you hired me.
13127,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,I’m signing off now.
13128,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Venkatesh,"Call your mother, she worries."
13129,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"Okay, just so you know, if we’re bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe."
13130,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn’t want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I’m sending it back. Where’s the ring?"
13131,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men’s room.
13132,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,Give me that.
13133,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"No, it’s mine."
13134,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,It’s all of ours.
13135,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"Okay, now, this is ridiculous!"
13136,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,Then let go!
13137,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"I’m not letting go, you let go."
13138,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.
13139,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,Fine. But can’t we go home and start this?
13140,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,Sure. Let go of the ring.
13141,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"All right, it starts now."
13142,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,You do realize there’s a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel.
13143,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"Wait, my laptop."
13144,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"You know, there’s a point when this becomes idiotic."
13145,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,And it wasn’t when we were driving like this?
13146,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.
13147,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.
13148,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"There are six seasons, dude."
13149,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"Oh, crap!"
13150,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"No, no, no, the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken, and then Mr. Big shows up, we don’t know if we can trust him again. It’s a wild ride."
13151,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,Door.
13152,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"Okay, everybody, and plie. And relevae."
13153,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,Whatcha doin’?
13154,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly."
13155,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,"No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me."
13156,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,Thank you.
13157,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,"FYI, this is a bag from Victoria’s Secret."
13158,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,I’m out.
13159,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"I’m sorry, Ma, I have to stay late at the office."
13160,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"No, he’s doesn’t! He’s lying to you!"
13161,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,Will you be quiet?
13162,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. I’m so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard, here’s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa’s G-string!"
13163,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,I’ll call you back.
13164,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"I think it’s lovely you call your mommy and let her know you’re going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesn’t breast-feed on time, it’s very uncomfortable for her boobies."
13165,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,Don’t you talk about my mother’s boobies!
13166,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"If you’re offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother’s boobies."
13167,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don’t you go after Raj’s mother?"
13168,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,Why don’t we go after your mother?
13169,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you’d like to add?"
13170,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,That’s not gonna Better pull out the big gun.
13171,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,You’re right. Let’s talk about your grandmother.
13172,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,No! I call no Meemaws.
13173,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.
13174,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,I don’t want to hear this.
13175,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,Then let go of the ring and walk away.
13176,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,Never.
13177,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,All right. I’ll bet your Meemaw didn’t just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.
13178,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,Stop it!
13179,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty."
13180,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,I said stop it!
13181,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,We’re getting to him.
13182,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,Waterfalls!
13183,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,What?
13184,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.
13185,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,What are you doing?
13186,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,Subliminal messaging. I’m going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.
13187,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"It’s, it’s not working, dude."
13188,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"Oh-ho-ho, it’s working all right. I have to pee."
13189,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,Then let go of the ring and go.
13190,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,"No, actually, I wouldn’t mind going, too."
13191,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two…"
13192,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,"Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?"
13193,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,We stand up.
13194,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,Excellent choice.
13195,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,Three.
13196,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.
13197,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,I’ve done it! I’ve won! The ring is mine! It’s mine!
13198,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,We’re going to clean it up and make it pretty. My own. My love. My precious.
13199,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,Where’s the ring?
13200,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,It’s in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.
13201,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,The fires of Mount Doom?
13202,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,Peter Jackson’s office in New Zealand. It wasn’t ours.
13203,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Howard,You quit the game! You had no right to take it.
13204,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it."
13205,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Raj,"Well, so then we start the game over until there’s a winner."
13206,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,"There wasn’t ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? ‘Cause if it is, fine, I don’t want anything to do with you. And I don’t know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up!"
13207,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Sheldon,I knew it. Give us the precious!
13208,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Leonard,NEVER!
13209,3,17,the precious fragmentation,Penny,"Ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym."
13210,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,"Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their junk."
13211,3,18,the pants alternative,Howard,"Yeah, so?"
13212,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,"So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also use their ponytails."
13213,3,18,the pants alternative,Howard,What’s your point?
13214,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,"My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, I’d be very nervous around James Cameron."
13215,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example, why wasn’t William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?"
13216,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s Award for Science."
13217,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I’ll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?"
13218,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"Oh, I’m so glad you asked it like that. You."
13219,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,I won?
13220,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,You won.
13221,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It’s not astonishing, more like inevitable. I’m not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I’m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online."
13222,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,"Well, good for him."
13223,3,18,the pants alternative,Howard,"Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost."
13224,3,18,the pants alternative,Howard,Didn’t it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull?
13225,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,No.
13226,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"Hey, you didn’t want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don’t get glasses."
13227,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. Uh, mute, please."
13228,3,18,the pants alternative,Howard,"Uh, hang on, flaming arrow."
13229,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call  three years ago. I see. Wait. What happens if I choose not to give a speech? Uh-huh. And if I don’t want to forfeit the award? Well, you’ve got that tied up in a neat little bow. All right. Thank you."
13230,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,What?
13231,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I can’t give a speech.
13232,3,18,the pants alternative,Howard,"Well, no, you’re mistaken. You give speeches all the time. What you can’t do is shut up."
13233,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,"Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking."
13234,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.
13235,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"What, to you, is a large crowd?"
13236,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.
13237,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,"Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know, ’cause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it."
13238,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,I’m not accepting the award.
13239,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,Why not?
13240,3,18,the pants alternative,Howard,Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright.
13241,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,"That’s no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queen’s court."
13242,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Thank you. Yeah, I’ll bear that in mind if I’m ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize."
13243,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re being ridiculous."
13244,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,Am I? Let me tell you a story.
13245,3,18,the pants alternative,Howard,Where’s 70 children when you need ‘em?
13246,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours.
13247,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.
13248,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry, and before I knew it… oh, dear."
13249,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,"Oh, my God."
13250,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?"
13251,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,Don’t trample me.
13252,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Come on, Mother, you know why I can’t accept the award. With all due respect, I don’t think praying will help. No, I have not heard the song, Jesus, Take the Wheel. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don’t need to start singing it. Yes, I’ll buy it on the iTunes, Mother. Good-bye, Mother."
13253,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"Sit down, we want to talk to you."
13254,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?
13255,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,Just sit.
13256,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,We think we can help you with your stage fright.
13257,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, I doubt that. I haven’t figured out a way, and I’m much smarter than all of you."
13258,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,"Yes, but you’re not smarter than all of us put together."
13259,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry, that is what I meant."
13260,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,"Okay, your problem is, you’re trying to do this all by yourself."
13261,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men."
13262,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,I do like the X-Men.
13263,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,Did I see X-Men?
13264,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it."
13265,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,"Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it, Sheldon?"
13266,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"I don’t know. If you’re my X-Men, what are your powers?"
13267,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,"Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit. Might give you more confidence."
13268,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"That’s not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters, but go on. Leonard?"
13269,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.
13270,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?
13271,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and I’ve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently."
13272,3,18,the pants alternative,Howard,"Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I don’t know, some Indian meditation crap."
13273,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you’re saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me."
13274,3,18,the pants alternative,Howard,"My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. And that’s 24-7, buddy."
13275,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,And I appreciate the pretence.
13276,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,"So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?"
13277,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men."
13278,3,18,the pants alternative,Howard,"Oh, that’s not a good name."
13279,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,"Okay, Sheldon. I’m going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own fears."
13280,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"And yet, you can’t speak to women."
13281,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,"True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes."
13282,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Okay, but don’t punch me."
13283,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,What?
13284,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you’ll get a surprise, and then she’d punch me."
13285,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,I’m not going to punch you.
13286,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,That’s what my sister used to say.
13287,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,Do you want to do this or not?
13288,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,I’m sorry. Proceed.
13289,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?
13290,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis."
13291,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,"Okay, you’re in Sheldonopolis."
13292,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?"
13293,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,Whatever you like.
13294,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.
13295,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,Fine. You’re in Sheldon Square.
13296,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,Really? This time of year? It’s a bit nippy.
13297,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,"Then, put on a sweater."
13298,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.
13299,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,"Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater."
13300,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15% discount."
13301,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!
13302,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Look, I didn’t turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly."
13303,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,"All right. You’ve paid for a sweater, and you’re in Sheldon Square."
13304,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Hang on. It’s a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no."
13305,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,What now?
13306,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can’t run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror! Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum."
13307,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,I question your premise. How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?
13308,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,"It’ll give you confidence. You know, sometimes when I’m feeling all stressed out about something, I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life."
13309,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,Don’t you eventually realize you’re just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?
13310,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,"Yeah, that’s when I buy shoes. Now, let’s see what we’ve got. Ooh! This is nice."
13311,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,It’s only one colour.
13312,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,"Yeah, so?"
13313,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,That’s a lot of money for only one colour.
13314,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,Fine. Why don’t you pick out what you like.
13315,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,Hmm. This is pretty sharp.
13316,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,"No, you’re wrong."
13317,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"This is great. I had a suit like this when I was six. Okay, I think we have a winner."
13318,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,Where the hell d’you find that?
13319,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,In the prom department.
13320,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,It’s ridiculous.
13321,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,Says the former member of the Corn Queen’s Court.
13322,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,Please just try this one on.
13323,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison. This is absurd. I look like a clown.
13324,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"So, Sheldon, how you doing?"
13325,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"That’s how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph’s."
13326,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"I’m sorry, I’ll start again."
13327,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?
13328,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"Um, I don’t know, maybe."
13329,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal."
13330,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?
13331,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,I was wearing size a million pants.
13332,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,Why don’t we just talk?
13333,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle."
13334,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"Why don’t I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don’t feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that’s what’s happening here?"
13335,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Really, Leonard? You’re just going to try to recycle Adler’s doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph’s. And she’d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free."
13336,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, “Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.” But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother’s earlier “Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‘n’ Roll.” I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back."
13337,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,And how did that make you feel?
13338,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown’s aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.
13339,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,Go on.
13340,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,It wasn’t my fault. I had never seen my brother’s project. And my mother could’ve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.
13341,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"So, I hear you saying you’re angry with your mother."
13342,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"Damn right, I’m angry with my mother. For God’s sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That’s when the bed-wetting started again."
13343,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Thank you, Leonard."
13344,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,For what?
13345,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award ceremony."
13346,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"Wait, that’s it? I thought we had a whole hour!"
13347,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, I’d like to share with you a letter from Sheldon’s mother, who couldn’t be here tonight. Isn’t that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She’s proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. That’s what she calls him. Shelly, it’s a pet name. You know what my mother’s pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress. Dear Shelly. I am so proud of…"
13348,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, dear."
13349,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,What’s the matter?
13350,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,I’m getting dizzy.
13351,3,18,the pants alternative,Raj,Don’t worry. You’re surrounded by your C-Men.
13352,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,I can’t do this. I’m going to faint.
13353,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,"Here, drink this. It’ll relax you."
13354,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,Alcohol? I don’t drink alcohol.
13355,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,"Fine, faint."
13356,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"I don’t feel different, this alcohol’s defective."
13357,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,"Here, see if this one works."
13358,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"First of all, the projects were totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn’t hear me. If you’d like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, I’d like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me."
13359,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,I’m ready.
13360,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"Oh, right. Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour, Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
13361,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Thanks, shorty,I’ll take it from here. All right, you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? Well, then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side, bazinga! All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know you’re out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology department, only man who’s happy when they take his work for granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists, of course, but it’s only ’cause I have no respect for the field. Let’s get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? ‘Cause we’re scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And what’s the universe made of? I am so glad you asked."
13362,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"There’s antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,"
13363,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"neptunium, germanium… Everybody! And iron, americium, ruthenium, uranium, europium, zirconium, lutetium, vanadium… Just the Asians! And lanthanum and osmium, and astatine and radium…"
13364,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Penny, Leonard. Would you be able to answer some questions I’m having about the events of last night?"
13365,3,18,the pants alternative,Penny,Sure.
13366,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Question one, where are my pants?"
13367,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,You might want to check YouTube.
13368,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,What do I search?
13369,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,It’s already loaded. Just hit play.
13370,3,18,the pants alternative,On-screen Sheldon,"All right, people, let’s get down to the math. It is only three dimensional thinking that limits our imagination. Can I take my pants off over my head? Of course not. My body’s in the way. But if we had access to higher dimensions, we could move our pants around our bodies through the fourth dimension and our days of dropping trousers would be over."
13371,3,18,the pants alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, this couldn’t be any more humiliating."
13372,3,18,the pants alternative,Leonard,"Uh-uh, give it a minute."
13373,3,18,the pants alternative,On-screen Sheldon,"Now, for the astronomers in the audience, get ready to see the dark side of the moon. And here’s Uranus."
13374,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Having a little trouble catching your breath there?
13375,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"No, no, I’m good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder."
13376,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Do or do not. There is no try.
13377,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,Did you just quote Star Wars?
13378,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.
13379,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"Oh, my God. I’m lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you, Penny."
13380,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Oh. Oh. Thank you.
13381,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,You’re welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.
13382,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Oh, yeah, no, I, I’m, I’m glad."
13383,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,Good. Glad is good.
13384,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it’s getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep."
13385,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,Yeah.
13386,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Okay.
13387,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,Yeah.
13388,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Hmm.
13389,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"Yeah, probably."
13390,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Okay, good night, sweetie."
13391,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,Good night.
13392,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,"Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?"
13393,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Raj,"Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile."
13394,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant."
13395,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?
13396,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,What’s with him?
13397,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,Perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.
13398,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,Are you saying he’s man-struating?
13399,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels."
13400,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Raj,Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I’m talking about.
13401,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,"Okay, forget giant ants. How about giant rabbits?"
13402,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Raj,"Big or small, I don’t like rabbits. They always look like they’re about to say something, but they never do."
13403,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis."
13404,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Raj,Maybe that’s what they want to talk about.
13405,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,"Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?"
13406,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,I honestly don’t care.
13407,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Raj,"Really? Because every time we’ve talked about unusual animal genitals, you’ve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions."
13408,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,What do you want from me? I just don’t give a rat’s ass.
13409,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,Would that be a giant rat’s ass?
13410,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"For the record, giant rats are possible."
13411,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?
13412,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,"Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible."
13413,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,Of course they are. Leonard’s being one.
13414,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Raj,Maybe he’s having a lover’s spat with Penny.
13415,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"No, there was no spat."
13416,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,"Oh, but something happened."
13417,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,I don’t want to talk about it.
13418,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,But I sense you’re going to and I don’t want to hear about it. Excuse me.
13419,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,"What’d you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?"
13420,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Raj,"Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?"
13421,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,What? No.
13422,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Raj,"I’m just asking, dude. It happens."
13423,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Stuart,You guys still on for bowling tonight?
13424,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. In fact, I’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her."
13425,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Stuart,Oh. Ouch.
13426,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,That is what is referred to as a burn on you.
13427,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,Did you ask her to start waxing?
13428,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,No.
13429,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Raj,Did you start waxing?
13430,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,No.
13431,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,"While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?"
13432,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,I’m walking away from you now.
13433,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,That wasn’t a no.
13434,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Raj,"Yeah, I think we’re getting close."
13435,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? Because you can die that way.
13436,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Raj,"Oh, that would be a good way to go."
13437,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Hi.
13438,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"Oh, hey."
13439,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o’clock."
13440,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Oh, right, bowling."
13441,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,You don’t have to come if you don’t want to.
13442,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"No, no, it’s okay. I mean, let’s face it, you guys would get creamed without me."
13443,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage."
13444,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"It’s always nice chatting with you, Sheldon."
13445,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
13446,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Thinly veiled contempt.
13447,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Remember, seven o’clock."
13448,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Got it.
13449,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,Pacific Daylight time!
13450,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Bite me!
13451,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.
13452,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.
13453,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,These are my own bowling shoes.
13454,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,Then what’s with the disinfectant?
13455,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,I know where my feet have been.
13456,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Stuart,"Hey, Penny! And you guys. Albino Bob couldn’t make it, so I brought a substitute. I believe some of you know Wil Wheaton."
13457,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,"Hi, Sheldon. How’s it going?"
13458,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Well, well, well. If it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox."
13459,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,"You’re not still carrying a grudge because I beat you at that card tournament, are you?"
13460,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"I’m the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?"
13461,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,It tells me that I am living rent-free right here. You ready to bowl?
13462,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m ready. I don’t know if Stuart told you what you’re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny’s pretty good."
13463,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,Great. Then it’s on.
13464,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off."
13465,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,Yes!
13466,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it’s really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes. Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird."
13467,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,"Hey, I just wanted to tell you I’m a big fan."
13468,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,"Oh, thanks."
13469,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,"I’m sure you’re probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?"
13470,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Raj,"Ah, beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh, yeah."
13471,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,Chilli cheese fry?
13472,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.
13473,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,Really? You love them?
13474,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Yeah, why?"
13475,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,No reason. I’m just glad to hear you’re comfortable saying you love something.
13476,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Do you really want to get into this right now?
13477,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,Get into what? Why wouldn’t you love the chilli cheese fries? They’ve been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.
13478,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn’t know what to say."
13479,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"Okay, well, now you’ve had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?"
13480,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,I’m not sure.
13481,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,How can you not be sure?
13482,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Okay, this isn’t the place to have this conversation."
13483,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"No, the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night."
13484,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Don’t push it, Leonard."
13485,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,I am not pushing anything.
13486,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,You are. You don’t get to decide when I’m ready to say I love you!
13487,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Raj,"Ah, the premature I love you."
13488,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,I guessed premature. Does that count?
13489,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny,"
13490,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,What?
13491,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,This is for you.
13492,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Ice cream?
13493,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"I’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she’s upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream."
13494,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Um, Ach."
13495,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna."
13496,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Did Leonard send you over here?
13497,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"No, we haven’t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton."
13498,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Yeah, I’m sorry about that."
13499,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,I’m not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.
13500,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Again, I’m sorry."
13501,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.
13502,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,You’re kidding.
13503,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.
13504,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?"
13505,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,The part where I tell you I’ve engineered a rematch with Stuart’s team for tonight.
13506,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Oh, honey, I don’t know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now."
13507,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"You want me to remove him from the team? I’m the captain, I can do that."
13508,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"No, no, that’s okay. Just let me talk to him, and I’ll get back to you."
13509,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,When are you going to talk to him?
13510,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,I don’t know.
13511,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,He’s in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.
13512,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"You’re not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?"
13513,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question."
13514,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,I think we should talk now.
13515,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"What? No, it’s okay. We don’t have to talk ’cause there’s nothing to talk about. Everything’s good."
13516,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Really? So, you didn’t get all snarky ’cause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?"
13517,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"All right, maybe I overreacted. So we’re in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I’m a little ahead of you. That’s fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, ’cause let’s face it, I’ve been in this relationship two years longer than you."
13518,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you. It’s just that I’ve said the L word too soon before, and it didn’t work out very well."
13519,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,Really? I wouldn’t know what that’s like.
13520,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"I’m sorry. You know what I’m talking about, though."
13521,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"Yeah, I do."
13522,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"So, we’re good?"
13523,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"Yes, that’s what I’m telling you. We are good. We are great."
13524,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there’s a lot at stake here."
13525,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Attention, all bowlers. I’ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch."
13526,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,The Wesley Crushers?
13527,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley “Crushers.”"
13528,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,I don’t get it.
13529,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek.
13530,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Still don’t get it.
13531,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"It’s a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character’s name and adding the S, we imply that we we’ll be the crushers of Wesley."
13532,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Okay, I’m sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher."
13533,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"What? No! Again, it’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”"
13534,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,"You know, if you want it to mean you’re crushing Wesley, it’d be the “Wesley” Crushers."
13535,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,Do you people even hear yourselves? It’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s not the “Wesley” Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”
13536,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,"Hey, look. They named their team after me."
13537,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"No, it’s not the… Never mind."
13538,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Stuart,"So, we’re all clear on the bet and the stakes?"
13539,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis."
13540,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Stuart,Ouch again.
13541,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,"Hey, Sheldon, I just wanted you to know that I’m really looking forward to wiping the floor with you."
13542,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?"
13543,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,After you.
13544,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley."
13545,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,It’s customary for the player on the right-hand lane to bowl first.
13546,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,All right.
13547,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,"It’s a custom, not a rule."
13548,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,I so loathe you.
13549,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,"That’s right, Sheldon. Embrace the dark side."
13550,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,That’s not even from your franchise!
13551,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Stuart,"I, um, I want you to know that even though we’re on opposite sides, I, I bear you no ill will."
13552,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Thank you, Stuart. It’s nice to know."
13553,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Stuart,"Mmm, mmm. People from opposite sides often have good relationships. You know, Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria from West Side Story, what’s-his-name and the big blue chick in Avatar. I’m gonna bowl now."
13554,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Be the ball, Howard."
13555,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Howard,"Leave me alone, Sheldon."
13556,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,You weren’t the ball.
13557,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Hey, thanks."
13558,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"This is fun, huh?"
13559,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Yeah.
13560,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,It’s good that we got out and did something physical.
13561,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Mm-hmm.
13562,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That’s not what we’re doing tonight. Tonight we’re just throwing a ball at some pins."
13563,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Yeah, that’s right."
13564,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"Mm-hmm, and someday, we don’t know when, maybe you’ll love me back. Ooh, I’m up."
13565,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,All,Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don!
13566,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,Excuse me. I don’t know who you’re chanting for as I am currently the ball.
13567,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,All,The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!
13568,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say."
13569,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,I’m glad you patched things up with your boyfriend.
13570,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Oh, yeah, me, too."
13571,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,It’s always tough when the L bomb gets dropped and you’re not ready for it.
13572,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Tell me about it.
13573,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,"I dated this one girl, and I told her that I loved her, and she said she wasn’t sure. And she strung me along for almost two years. It was brutal."
13574,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Oh, I’m sorry."
13575,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,"Thanks. Yeah, I wish she had just broken up with me right there, put me out of my misery."
13576,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,Really?
13577,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,"Yeah, would have been kinder."
13578,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Stuart,"Wil, you’re up."
13579,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,"Oh, that’s me."
13580,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?
13581,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,What are you talking about?
13582,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,He’s evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?
13583,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,No!
13584,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Well, if he does, don’t believe it. He’s not above playing the dead meemaw card."
13585,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,Yes!
13586,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Enjoy the accolades now, Wil Wheaton, but like your time on Star Trek"
13587,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"Penny, you’re up."
13588,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"All right, remember, his meemaw’s alive and be the ball."
13589,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Yeah, I got it."
13590,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,We really need a strike here.
13591,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,I know.
13592,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,So just take your time and concentrate.
13593,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Leonard, stop pressuring me."
13594,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,I’m not pressuring you.
13595,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"Yeah, you are! Just back off!"
13596,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll shut up."
13597,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,I didn’t mean shut up.
13598,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it."
13599,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Penny,"No, this isn’t fair to you, Leonard. I’m sorry."
13600,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I’ll get you ice cream!"
13601,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,"No, let her go."
13602,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"Are you insane? If she leaves, it’s over!"
13603,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Leonard,I’m pretty sure it’s already over.
13604,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,"Tough luck, Sheldon."
13605,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"You did this, didn’t you?"
13606,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,Do you think I would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match?
13607,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,"No, I suppose not."
13608,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Wil,Good. Keep thinking that.
13609,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Sheldon,Wheaton!
13610,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Stuart,"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah, I’m telling you the Match.com chicks are much looser than on eHarmony. You know, I, I gotta call you back. I won a bet, and it’s time to collect."
13611,3,19,the wheaton recurrence,Raj,"I don’t know about you, but I feel empowered."
13612,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,Hu-u-u-uh…. Hu-u-u-uh!
13613,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,Problem?
13614,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,This is Thai food.
13615,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,Here we go.
13616,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,We don’t have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.
13617,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday."
13618,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday."
13619,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we’ve been in lately."
13620,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we’re going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let’s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra."
13621,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,I could go for some goat.
13622,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Sheldon, we agreed we’d do something different tonight."
13623,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,All right. Let’s go to the comic book store.
13624,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,We went to the comic book store last night.
13625,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, we’ll be going on Thursday, because it’s Anything Can Happen Thursday."
13626,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon."
13627,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,So what are we going to do tonight?
13628,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies’ Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots."
13629,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero."
13630,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?
13631,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?"
13632,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient."
13633,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,The Wolowitz Coefficient?
13634,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius."
13635,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,You’re joking.
13636,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"I’m a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex."
13637,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,"Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s bounce, bitches."
13638,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"You’re right. It’s Anything Can Happen Thursday, let’s hit the clubs and meet hot women!"
13639,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We’re going to hit it and quit it.
13640,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.
13641,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,Also a good plan.
13642,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we’re definitely going to a bar."
13643,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Oh, absolutely."
13644,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,"You heard that, Ladies’ Night ladies? We’re eventually coming for you!"
13645,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,Fascinating.
13646,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"Oh hey, guys, where’re you headed?"
13647,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"To the comic book store. You’re probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday."
13648,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"You got me. While you’re there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?"
13649,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.
13650,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew’s birthday?"
13651,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,Sure. What does he like?
13652,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"I don’t know, he’s 13. Just pick out anything."
13653,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows."
13654,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.
13655,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?"
13656,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,Leonard?
13657,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"You know this can go on all night, why don’t you just come with us?"
13658,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"Ugh, that’s what I was trying to avoid."
13659,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man."
13660,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"Oh, what a cute, little store. Everybody’s staring at me."
13661,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Don’t worry, they’re more scared of you than you are of them."
13662,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?"
13663,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,A superb choice.
13664,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"Oh, great."
13665,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse."
13666,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,What’s a multiverse?
13667,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,Get her out of here.
13668,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Come on, I’ll help you pick something."
13669,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,That’s right. She’s with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.
13670,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle."
13671,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Store clerk,"Oh, hey, Leonard. Can I help you find something?"
13672,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She’s looking for some comic books."
13673,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"Oh, really. Blink twice if you’re here against your will."
13674,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"I think we’re fine, Stuart."
13675,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,Let me know if you need anything.
13676,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.
13677,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,You mean for someone who’s into comic books?
13678,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"No, no, no, I just meant for… yeah."
13679,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn’t make them weirdos. Stuart’s a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design."
13680,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?
13681,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Ah, yeah, that’s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn’t really help the point I’m trying to make."
13682,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Let it go, Sheldon."
13683,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,Why should I let it go? I saw it first.
13684,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Yes, but I saw it from the front."
13685,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,A far less impressive feat.
13686,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection."
13687,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,I need it for my Robin collection.
13688,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
13689,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,Why would I gamble? It’s mine. Let go.
13690,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,You let go.
13691,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"No, you!"
13692,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,Problem?
13693,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Yes, he won’t let go of my comic book."
13694,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,It’s my comic book!
13695,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Leonard, we need a ruling."
13696,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Uh, cut it in half?"
13697,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,Excuse me.
13698,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,Hello again.
13699,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?
13700,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"A 13-year-old girl. But if you’re dead set on a comic book, try this."
13701,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"Oh, Hellblazer. What’s this about?"
13702,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"A morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes, has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead."
13703,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"Well, if that doesn’t make me the favourite aunt, I don’t know what will. Is this me?"
13704,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,Depends. Do you like it?
13705,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,It’s really good.
13706,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"Yes, that’s you."
13707,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"That’s so sweet, but what if I didn’t like it?"
13708,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"It’d still be you, but I’d feel like an idiot."
13709,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,I don’t believe it. Stuart’s putting the moves on Penny.
13710,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!
13711,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests."
13712,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,"Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny’s business over there?"
13713,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Nobody’s up in anybody’s business, let’s just buy our stuff and go."
13714,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"Okay, you’ve got my number, now, give me the picture."
13715,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"You drive a hard bargain, but here."
13716,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"All right. So, um, just give me a call."
13717,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?"
13718,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Look at that, that’s a dent. Thank you, Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?"
13719,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,Apparently so.
13720,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,Are you ill?
13721,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,No.
13722,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,All right. Then is it fair to say that you’re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?
13723,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,When did you pick up on that?
13724,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?"
13725,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Sure, why not?"
13726,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section."
13727,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Gee, thanks a lot."
13728,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,Would you rather I offer my personal insight?
13729,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,I don’t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny’s more interested in Stuart than me. We’re practically the same guy.
13730,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books."
13731,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"You’re right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet."
13732,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,My original point.
13733,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be."
13734,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,Who’s up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?
13735,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"Oh, hey guys."
13736,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Hey, Penny… and Stuart, hey Stuart."
13737,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"Hey, guys."
13738,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,So what are you kids up to?
13739,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that’s opening tonight."
13740,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"And you guys are going together, great…"
13741,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,It is great. Really great. Freaking awesome. What are you guys doing?
13742,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"It’s Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?"
13743,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Vintage doesn’t even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It’s the buggy beta version."
13744,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun."
13745,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"Yeah, see you guys."
13746,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"See you, Stuart."
13747,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Hey, Howard?"
13748,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,Yes.
13749,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,Take me to a bar with women.
13750,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,Really?
13751,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,Yeah.
13752,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,Okay! Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.
13753,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,Why?
13754,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Well, if I get lucky, I don’t want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs."
13755,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,Do you…?
13756,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,"May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?"
13757,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"No, he may not."
13758,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,Why?
13759,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,I’m not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.
13760,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,Fine. I’ll have a chocolate martini.
13761,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,Wrong again!
13762,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,"Come on, you know I can’t talk to women unless I’m lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali."
13763,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn’t have to because there are no women in them."
13764,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,Gotcha. I’ll have a Brandy Alexander.
13765,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo."
13766,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,Should we talk to some of these women?
13767,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"It’s way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame."
13768,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,That’s your system?
13769,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"That’s my system. Oh, and if you spot a chick with a Seeing Eye dog, she’s mine."
13770,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,Oh come on. I think it’s nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.
13771,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn’t touched all the cheese."
13772,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"Um, you know, it’s kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?"
13773,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"Oh, gee, it’s a little late for coffee, isn’t it?"
13774,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf."
13775,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?"
13776,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"Uh, yeah, I guess."
13777,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,"Sheldon, we’re a little busy here, so…"
13778,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,What are you doing?
13779,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,We’re having coffee.
13780,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,Isn’t it a little late for coffee?
13781,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,It’s okay. She thinks she has decaf.
13782,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,I’ll just go look for it.
13783,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,What’s up?
13784,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Well, I’ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help."
13785,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,Oh yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn. What’s the topic?
13786,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"I am asserting, in the event that Batman’s death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl."
13787,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"Ooh, Sheldon, I’m afraid you couldn’t be more wrong."
13788,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.
13789,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"Of course it is. It’s a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable, it’s very wrong to say it’s a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right. Batman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd."
13790,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,Has to be? Has to be? I hope you’re being deliberately provocative.
13791,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Penny,I found the decaf!
13792,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"Oh, great!"
13793,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Yeah, herbal tea for me, please."
13794,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Raj,Barkeep! Alexander me.
13795,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,How about those two?
13796,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Nah, they’re eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week."
13797,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,What about the ones in the corner?
13798,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?"
13799,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,I think Blinky’s cute.
13800,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"You got it, sir."
13801,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Wait, so we just go over there?"
13802,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my friend’s had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean, they’re laughing, we’re laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we’re millionaires."
13803,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,What else you got?
13804,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?
13805,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,No.
13806,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"I can’t sit on your lap, you don’t know the routine."
13807,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"I’m sorry, but you’re obviously stuck in a pre-Zero Hour DC universe."
13808,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’être.
13809,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"Okay, you can throw all the French around you want, it doesn’t make you right."
13810,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,Au contraire.
13811,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"Plus, you’re forgetting that the Infinite Crisis storyline restored Joe Chill to the Batman mythology."
13812,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.
13813,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"Okay, look, Sheldon, it’s late and I’ve got to get some sleep."
13814,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"So, I win."
13815,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"No, I’m tired."
13816,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"So, I win."
13817,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,Fine. You win.
13818,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"Darn tootin’, I win."
13819,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"Penny, I really had a terrific time. Penny?"
13820,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, don’t wake her. She’ll maul you like a rabid wolverine."
13821,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Stuart,"You know, I don’t think that was decaf."
13822,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Wait, is this your card or isn’t it? Trust me, this was their card."
13823,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,I thought you were good at this. You’re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.
13824,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"I do, all the time."
13825,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Well, what happened? We’ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you’ve had with a woman was when your mom called."
13826,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Wow, you’re just going to make me come out and say it, aren’t you?"
13827,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,Say what?
13828,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,You’re weighing me down. I’m a falcon who hunts better solo.
13829,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,Fine. I’ll sit here. You take flight and hunt.
13830,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Don’t be ridiculous, you can’t just tell a falcon when to hunt."
13831,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Leonard,"Actually, you can. There’s a whole sport built around it. Falconry."
13832,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,Shut up. Let’s just get Koothrappali and go.
13833,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,Lucky bastard. It’s got to be that stupid accent of his.
13834,3,20,the hofstader isotope,Howard,"Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. Okay, I’m stumped."
13835,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,Hold.
13836,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,What?
13837,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,Explain your sneeze.
13838,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,I’m sorry?
13839,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,Do you have allergies?
13840,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,No.
13841,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,Is there too much pepper on your salad?
13842,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,I don’t put pepper on salads.
13843,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,I’ve heard enough. Sit over there.
13844,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,"Oh, come on. I don’t want to sit by myself."
13845,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"That’s what Typhoid Mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled."
13846,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,"Guys, help me."
13847,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,"Sheldon, come on."
13848,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s just one sneeze. ("
13849,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,You’re on your own.
13850,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,"See you, buddy."
13851,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment."
13852,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?"
13853,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys."
13854,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?
13855,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
13856,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,"Yes, but mixed with genuine concern."
13857,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"For your information, I’ll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton."
13858,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,The cosmological physicist from Princeton?
13859,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. We’ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now she’s under consideration for a position at our university."
13860,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,Why didn’t you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!
13861,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"I didn’t realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you’re a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I’ve been to Toronto."
13862,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?"
13863,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"My room, of course."
13864,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,Holy crap!
13865,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,"Yeah, um, I have a two-part question."
13866,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,Go ahead.
13867,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,"A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?"
13868,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga."
13869,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,So you’re saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?
13870,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?
13871,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
13872,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Well, she doesn’t care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don’t open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one’s wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?"
13873,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,When can I sit with you again?
13874,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"When I’ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if you’ll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics."
13875,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,I can’t believe he’s friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.
13876,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,I can’t believe they let him into Canada.
13877,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You heard the man. Where’s your throat cultures? Kidding. Sit down."
13878,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
13879,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?"
13880,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"What? What are you doing with, what?"
13881,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.
13882,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?"
13883,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.
13884,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,Oh. What?
13885,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel."
13886,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You’re having a woman stay with you?"
13887,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?
13888,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"Oh, no, no, no, no. I’m not flabbergasted. I’m puzzled. Yeah, let’s go with puzzled."
13889,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber."
13890,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,Female jibber jabber?
13891,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina."
13892,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"Oh, they’re not my friends."
13893,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"I’m not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs."
13894,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"She’s here, she’s here. How do I look? Do I look smart?"
13895,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Oh, good grief. This isn’t about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event."
13896,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer."
13897,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"Ah, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness. I completely forgot your address. But then I remembered that I’d written it on my hand. Lucky for me, I didn’t confuse it with what I’d written on my other hand, which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star. ‘Cause if I tried to go there, I’d be crushed by hypergravity. Anyway, hello."
13898,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,Hello.
13899,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,Nice to finally meet you in person.
13900,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter."
13901,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh, it’s nice to meet you. I’ve read both your books and most of your papers. I’m  Leonard, I live here, you’re brilliant."
13902,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,I apologize. He’s only an experimental physicist.
13903,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"No need to apologize. Some of my best friends are experimental physicists. Well, not my best friends, but I know them. My best friend is a molecular chemist named Wendy. I’m sorry, I’m rambling. Hi-lo."
13904,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?"
13905,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"No, she’s my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?"
13906,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"Interesting choices. Based on my current needs, I guess I’d pick the yogurt."
13907,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles."
13908,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Look, it’s you."
13909,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,Thank you so much for opening up your home to me.
13910,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Well, who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that don’t open, those crazy card-shaped keys."
13911,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,I’m so glad you understand.
13912,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"No, he doesn’t understand. I understand."
13913,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Well, I understand, too."
13914,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,You’re just misappropriating my understanding.
13915,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Oh, I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would’ve already wanted you before they, you know, got you."
13916,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room.
13917,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"All right. I guess I am tired. Good night, Leonard."
13918,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I’m smart."
13919,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Get it together, man."
13920,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There’s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand."
13921,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,Good to know.
13922,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"In here, you’ll find emergency provisions. An eight-day supply of food and water, a crossbow, season two of Star Trek"
13923,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,What if there’s a disaster that destroys all the USB ports?
13924,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Then there’s really no reason to live, is there?"
13925,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,Can I ask a question about your roommate?
13926,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"He’s an odd duck, isn’t he?"
13927,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,What’s his relationship status?
13928,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. That’s why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you’ll find in the bathroom. They’re in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes."
13929,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,Okay.
13930,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,Good. I’ll leave you to your night time ablutions. I’ve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You’ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It’s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.
13931,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,How thoughtful.
13932,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Sleep well, my friend."
13933,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"You, too."
13934,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Oh, let me just get one thing. It’s my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn’t pass through here. Now, good night. And if there’s an apocalypse, good luck."
13935,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,Yes?
13936,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,I saw your light on.
13937,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,Is everything all right?
13938,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"Yeah, I just couldn’t sleep."
13939,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Me neither. Oh, look what I’m reading. It’s you."
13940,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,I thought you already read it.
13941,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"I did, but it’s been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast."
13942,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"Aw, you’re smart."
13943,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Oh, good. Wasn’t sure it was coming across."
13944,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,What chapter are you on?
13945,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Uh, six."
13946,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"Oh, the extragalactic distance ladder. Want to know a little secret?"
13947,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,Sure.
13948,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,I wrote the section on the Wilson-Bappu Effect completely naked.
13949,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Really? Uh, sure doesn’t read that way."
13950,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"Here, let me show you. When we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars, we start to see"
13951,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,a possible explanation for some of the discrepancies found in Hubble’s constant.
13952,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,Wow. You really make science come alive.
13953,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.
13954,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Morning, Sheldon."
13955,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,Morning.
13956,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"Morning, Sheldon."
13957,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.
13958,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,More than pleasant.
13959,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Excuse me, I’m going to relieve myself."
13960,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,How do you take your coffee?
13961,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,Black.
13962,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,Okeydoke.
13963,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Pee for Houston, pee for Austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. And shake twice for Texas."
13964,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,Something his mother taught him.
13965,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection."
13966,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"That’s very thoughtful, but I think I’ll finish my coffee first."
13967,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Ah, so the yogurt didn’t work. I’ll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer."
13968,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"Oh, good, you’re up. Look, my car won’t start. I need a ride to work."
13969,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,Did you once again ignore your check engine light?
13970,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"No, Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light."
13971,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work."
13972,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug."
13973,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,Hello.
13974,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,Hi.
13975,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress who doesn’t understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine."
13976,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,Nice to meet you.
13977,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"Nice to meet you, too. Are you enjoying your stay?"
13978,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"Yes, very much."
13979,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,Good.
13980,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard’s bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him."
13981,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,Excuse me.
13982,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldon’s friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. It’ll be fun. Like a clown car."
13983,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,Hang on.
13984,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?
13985,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,We just broke up.
13986,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"What, uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?"
13987,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,Not as good as you apparently.
13988,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"I, um, I don’t follow."
13989,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"You know what? It’s, it’s none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon’s doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it."
13990,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Well, now…"
13991,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Excuse me. I’m uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do."
13992,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,I’m not recommending it. I’m saying it already happened.
13993,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"That’s preposterous. Tell her, Leonard."
13994,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,Well…
13995,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,No.
13996,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,Come on. It wasn’t my fault.
13997,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?
13998,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,You know what? I’m just gonna take the bus to work.
13999,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Penny, I can still drive you."
14000,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"Oh, no, no, it’s okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant."
14001,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"I must say, I’m shocked by this betrayal."
14002,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,I didn’t betray Penny.
14003,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Not Penny, me!"
14004,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,How am I betraying you?
14005,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Elizabeth’s my friend, and you’re playing with her!"
14006,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Yeah, I guess I did."
14007,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,What the hell are you doing?
14008,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,"Relax, it’s Nyquil."
14009,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,You still have a cold?
14010,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,"Maybe, but I don’t care. That’s the great thing about Nyquil, it’s like ten-percent booze. I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, so you can talk to girls medicine."
14011,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Are you having trouble sleeping? ‘Cause, boy, I was up all night."
14012,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,"Did you get a cold, too?"
14013,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"No, but I was awake all night."
14014,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,"If you want, I can give you some of my mom’s sleeping pills."
14015,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,She won’t notice they’re missing?
14016,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,She doesn’t know she takes them.
14017,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"No, that’s okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And, I didn’t mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn’t mind. Those are your clues."
14018,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,"Ooh, ooh. Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?"
14019,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,No.
14020,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,Were you up making another stop-motion Lego movie?
14021,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,No.
14022,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,"‘Cause let me tell you, it’s not enough to make the Legos move, they also have to capture your heart."
14023,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Okay, I’ll give you one more clue. It involved another person."
14024,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,Did you get a Japanese love pillow?
14025,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,How is a Japanese love pillow another person?
14026,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,It is if you love her and give her a name.
14027,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"Dr. Plimpton, I’d like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali"
14028,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,Hi.
14029,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.
14030,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,Hi.
14031,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,I’m a big fan of your work.
14032,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,Thank you.
14033,3,21,the plimption simulation,Sheldon,"And of course, you’ve already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter."
14034,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Hey, you."
14035,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"Hey, you."
14036,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Boy, I’m kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling, Elizabeth?"
14037,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,You know what? I am a little tired. Would you be a dear and get me a cup of coffee?
14038,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Sure. Black, right?"
14039,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"Actually, now I think I want it hot, brown and sweet."
14040,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,Coming right up.
14041,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,What?
14042,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,What do you mean what? It’s Halo night.
14043,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,I can’t. I’m too sick. Go away.
14044,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,"That’s why we moved Halo night here. Look, I brought my mom’s chicken soup."
14045,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,I’m not hungry.
14046,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,Don’t send him away. Let him in.
14047,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,Who’s that
14048,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,I bought a parrot.
14049,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,"Yeah, right. Dr. Plimpton?"
14050,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"Hi. Howard, right?"
14051,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,"Uh, yeah."
14052,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"Can I ask you a question, Howard? Do you like role-playing games?"
14053,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,"Yeah, sure. In fact, I’m a dungeon master."
14054,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"Not tonight. Tonight you are a delivery man. You brought soup, but uh-oh, Raj and I don’t have enough money to pay you. So we’ll have to come to some other kind of arrangement."
14055,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,Beg pardon?
14056,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"You two figure out the details, I’m going to go change into something I don’t mind getting ripped off my milky flesh."
14057,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,What the frak?
14058,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,"Go away. She wants New Delhi, not Kosher deli. Besides, you have a girlfriend."
14059,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,We broke up weeks ago.
14060,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,Why didn’t you say anything?
14061,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,I was waiting for the right time. This is the right time.
14062,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Hey, who’s ready for Halo?"
14063,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,"Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost!"
14064,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,He’s right. The numbers are shaky enough as it is.
14065,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,I don’t understand.
14066,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"Oh, good. Leonard’s here."
14067,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,Good?
14068,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,Elizabeth? What’s going on?
14069,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,What’s going on is you and Howard are my moving men and Raj is my new landlord and I don’t have enough money to pay any of you.
14070,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,Is she suggesting what I think she’s suggesting?
14071,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,Yep. Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.
14072,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,"Okay, show of hands. Who’s up for this?"
14073,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,We’ll all be naked in front of each other.
14074,3,21,the plimption simulation,Howard,I’m out.
14075,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,Everybody ready?
14076,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,"Follow my lead. Almost. We’re, we’re going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance."
14077,3,21,the plimption simulation,Elizabeth,"Oh, good. It’s so much better when everyone commits."
14078,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,"Run. Run, run, run. Don’t look back."
14079,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,I thought we had something special.
14080,3,21,the plimption simulation,Raj,"So, you say you can’t pay your rent?"
14081,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"Oh, Leonard?"
14082,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,Hey.
14083,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,I found these in the dryer. I’m assuming they belong to Sheldon.
14084,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Thanks. It’s really hard to find these in his size. So, listen. I’ve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning."
14085,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?
14086,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Yeah, I wanted to explain."
14087,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"Well, you don’t owe me an explanation."
14088,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,I don’t?
14089,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"No, you don’t."
14090,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,So you’re not judging me?
14091,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,"Oh, I’m judging you nine ways to Sunday, but you don’t owe me an explanation."
14092,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,"Nevertheless, I’d like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did."
14093,3,21,the plimption simulation,Penny,I’m listening.
14094,3,21,the plimption simulation,Leonard,She let me.
14095,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"Okay, Babydoll Pink, let’s see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad’s feet."
14096,3,22,the staircase improvement,Sheldon,This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.
14097,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"Aw, screw the roommate agreement!"
14098,3,22,the staircase improvement,Sheldon,"No, you don’t screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you."
14099,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat."
14100,3,22,the staircase improvement,Sheldon,"I don’t have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, I’m there already!"
14101,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,Who is it?
14102,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,Leonard.
14103,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,Hang on.
14104,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,Can I sleep on your couch tonight?
14105,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy."
14106,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"You heard that, huh?"
14107,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy."
14108,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"So you agree, he’s nuts."
14109,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him."
14110,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him."
14111,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"Oh, I do not believe that."
14112,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago.
14113,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,I’d just started at the university.
14114,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Excuse me, I’m looking for Sheldon Cooper’s apartment."
14115,3,22,the staircase improvement,Man with a box,"Oh, I bet you’re here to check out the room for rent."
14116,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,Yeah.
14117,3,22,the staircase improvement,Man,"Run away, dude."
14118,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,What?
14119,3,22,the staircase improvement,Man,"Run fast, run far."
14120,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,That should have been my first clue.
14121,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,So Sheldon’s last roommate tried to warn you off?
14122,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look."
14123,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"Well, yeah, he’d been living with Sheldon."
14124,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"Sure, it makes sense now."
14125,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door."
14126,3,22,the staircase improvement,Large Black Transvestite,Yeah?
14127,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,Dr. Cooper?
14128,3,22,the staircase improvement,Transvestite,"No, you want the crazy guy across the hall."
14129,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"In retrospect, that was clue number two."
14130,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Yes?
14131,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,I’m Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You said…
14132,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"I know what I said. I know what you said. I know what my mother said on March 5, 1992. What is the sixth noble gas?"
14133,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,What?
14134,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,You said you’re a scientist. What is the sixth noble gas?
14135,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Uh, radon?"
14136,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Are you asking me or telling me?
14137,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,Telling you? Telling you.
14138,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"All right, next question. Kirk or Picard?"
14139,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Oh, uh, well, that’s tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk."
14140,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Correct. You’ve passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. You may enter.
14141,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Oh, this is pretty nice. Uh, the bedrooms are back there?"
14142,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,That depends.
14143,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"I don’t understand, their, their existence is conditional?"
14144,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers."
14145,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,There’s three?
14146,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Each more daunting than the last. Have a seat.
14147,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,Okay.
14148,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,No! That’s where I sit!
14149,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,What’s the difference?
14150,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. As a result, I’ve placed it in a state of eternal dibs."
14151,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,Can you do that?
14152,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"Cathedra mea, regulae meae. That’s Latin for my chair, my rules. Now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics."
14153,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Uh, yeah, experimental physics."
14154,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Hmm.
14155,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,What is that?
14156,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Doesn’t concern you. You’ll be going to the university every day?
14157,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,Yes.
14158,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,And you have a vehicle?
14159,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"A car, yeah."
14160,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,And you’ll be willing to drive me?
14161,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Well, can’t you drive?"
14162,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,I can. I choose not to.
14163,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well that’s a point in my favour, right?"
14164,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Why don’t you let me do this.
14165,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Come on, I just asked."
14166,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"Last question. In a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?"
14167,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Uh, I’m gonna go with preserving the knowledge."
14168,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"That’s correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I’ll show you the rest of the apartment."
14169,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Oh, good. I passed the barriers."
14170,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,The second barrier. Don’t get cocky. This is the bathroom. Are you fairly regular?
14171,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Uh, I guess."
14172,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,This isn’t going to work if you’re guessing. When do you evacuate your bowels?
14173,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,When I have to.
14174,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"When you have to? I’m sorry, I don’t rent to hippies."
14175,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"I, I’m sorry, uh, in the morning. Around eight."
14176,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,I can’t give you eight. I can give you seven thirty.
14177,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,Fine. I’ll take it.
14178,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Third barrier passed. You have won the right to see your room. Huzzah!
14179,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,Is this it?
14180,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"No, this is my room. People don’t go in my room."
14181,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,So where do you sleep?
14182,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,I don’t understand.
14183,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"If people don’t go in there, and you’re people, and… You are people, aren’t you? Making a joke."
14184,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Do you do this often?
14185,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,On occasion.
14186,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Your room. You may want to repaint.
14187,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?"
14188,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"No, I didn’t just move in. First we had to iron out a few details."
14189,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon’s brilliant new series Firefly.
14190,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,Does that really need to be in the agreement?
14191,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"We might as well settle it now, it’s going to be on for years. Initial here. All right, that’s television and movies. Section nine, miscellany. The apartment’s flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure."
14192,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,We have a flag?
14193,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"Never fly it upside down unless the apartment’s in distress. And next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds."
14194,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,Okay.
14195,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Well that’s disappointing.
14196,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,Why on earth did you agree to all that?
14197,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"It was the best apartment I’d seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you’ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way."
14198,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"Well, I’m sorry, Leonard, it’s very hard to feel sympathy for you."
14199,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over."
14200,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Leonard?
14201,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,Shh. Just pretend we’re not here.
14202,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Leonard?Leonard?
14203,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,I’m sure he’ll go away.
14204,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,I’m just going to keep knocking till you answer. Leonard? Leonard?
14205,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,What do you want? I didn’t say come in!
14206,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"You asked what I wanted. I wanted to come in. I’m here because you violated our roommate agreement. Specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection C, females, paragraph four, coitus. Roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus.”"
14207,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,I didn’t even know her 12 hours ago.
14208,3,22,the staircase improvement,Joyce Kim,That’s it! I’m out of here!
14209,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"But, Joyce, come on."
14210,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,12 hours?
14211,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"Oh, my God."
14212,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,Do I get some sympathy now?
14213,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you’re doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?"
14214,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"Actually, I couldn’t get too mad at him about Joyce Kim."
14215,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,Why not?
14216,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It’s kind of secret."
14217,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?
14218,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I’m not saying I would have."
14219,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"So, what, that’s it? You’ve stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?"
14220,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.
14221,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"Oh, yeah, I’m wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in."
14222,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work…"
14223,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,What is going on here?
14224,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon. This is Howard and Raj. They work at the university, too."
14225,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,Hey.
14226,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Raj,Hey.
14227,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,I’ll get to you later. What are you sitting on?
14228,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,"I can’t speak for these guys, but I’m sitting on my tushie. It’s a joke."
14229,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Yeah, not a good idea."
14230,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Raj,"Tushie is buttocks, right?"
14231,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,Right.
14232,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Raj,Hilarious.
14233,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Explain the couch.
14234,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. Howard and Raj helped me bring it up."
14235,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,But what’s wrong with the furniture we have?
14236,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,They’re lawn chairs. And there was no place for company.
14237,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Did it occur to you that was by design?
14238,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"According to the roommate agreement, I’m entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas."
14239,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"But you didn’t notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach."
14240,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,I did notify you.
14241,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"Oh, you did, did you? Oh, drat! Hoisted by my own spam filter."
14242,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,What am I doing in your spam folder?
14243,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"I put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled this is funny."
14244,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Raj,"Oh, yeah, I saw that. That was hilarious."
14245,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?"
14246,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,I’m getting to it.
14247,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"I assure you, you’ll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with theirs."
14248,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Raj,"Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?"
14249,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Yes.
14250,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,And you just assume you’re always right?
14251,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,It’s not an assumption. Change seats with me.
14252,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Raj,Why?
14253,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,I don’t like this spot. I have to keep turning my head.
14254,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Raj,Fine.
14255,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Ooh, it’s time for Babylon 5!"
14256,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,We don’t watch Babylon 5 in this apartment.
14257,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,Why not?
14258,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Because no one likes Babylon 5.
14259,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,I like it.
14260,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Raj,"Me, too."
14261,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,So do I.
14262,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,There you go– three against one.
14263,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"They don’t get a vote. It’s one against one. And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me."
14264,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,But I said no to that.
14265,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,And I said yes. And I settle all ties. Change seats with me.
14266,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,Why?
14267,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,There’s a draft on my neck over here.
14268,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,"So, I get the draft?"
14269,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,You’re protected by your turtleneck.
14270,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,Fine. And it’s a dickey.
14271,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"Hmm, I’m still not comfortable. Of course. There’s too many people here."
14272,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,We can fix that. Let’s leave.
14273,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,"Yeah, we can go over to my place."
14274,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Wait. Let me get my jacket.
14275,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,You’re not going with us.
14276,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Why not?
14277,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Raj,You’re the guy we’re trying to get away from.
14278,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"Oh. Well, in that case, I don’t need my jacket. And for the record, the correct syntax is I’m the guy from whom you’re trying to get away. Oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot."
14279,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room."
14280,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?"
14281,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,Fine. Go ahead.
14282,3,22,the staircase improvement,Mrs Wolowitz,"Howard, are you having a playdate?"
14283,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,I don’t have playdates! I have colleagues!
14284,3,22,the staircase improvement,Mrs Wolowitz,Do their parents know they’re here?
14285,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,"No, but if you keep screaming, maybe they’ll hear you!"
14286,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,That your dad?
14287,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,"She grows any more hair on her face, yes."
14288,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?"
14289,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,Three. I designed the engine myself.
14290,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Raj,Cool. Can it break Mach 1?
14291,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,"Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel the government’s been working on."
14292,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Oh, this just might be your lucky day."
14293,3,22,the staircase improvement,Mrs Wolowitz,"Howard, what happened to the Oreos I left on the counter?!"
14294,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,I haven’t seen your Oreos! Just take your bath without them!
14295,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"So, why was it his lucky day?"
14296,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment."
14297,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?
14298,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living, and I was going to kind of show it to her. It’s not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment."
14299,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,Are we ever going to get to the elevator?
14300,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"Yeah, we’re really close. Uh, uh, we’re at the apartment."
14301,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"The trick is to mix it into Tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8,000 kilonewtons of thrust."
14302,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,Nice.
14303,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Raj,Cool.
14304,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Won’t work.
14305,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Excuse me, but I’ve been working on this a long time. Trust me, it’ll work."
14306,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"You don’t see your mistake, do you?"
14307,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,There’s no mistake.
14308,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,"This is for a full-scale rocket, not a model."
14309,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Well, I’ve adjusted the formula."
14310,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Not correctly.
14311,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,"Okay, I’ve had it with you. You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. And when it comes to applied physic… uh-oh."
14312,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,What’s happening?
14313,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,A bad thing. A very bad thing. Get the door. Get the door! Get the door! Get the door! Get the door!
14314,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Howard,You’re waiting for the elevator?
14315,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,Oh. Right.
14316,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Raj,Wait. It’s here.
14317,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,Give me that.
14318,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Leonard,What’d you do that for? I had plenty of time.
14319,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Sheldon,You’re welcome.
14320,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn’t rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security."
14321,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"Okay, so, basically, you’re the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?"
14322,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,So I did something stupid. I’m sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?
14323,3,22,the staircase improvement,Penny,"Excuse me, I was in high school. Studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community."
14324,3,22,the staircase improvement,Past Penny,Not pregnant. Yes!
14325,3,22,the staircase improvement,Sheldon,"Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system."
14326,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,Hey.
14327,3,22,the staircase improvement,Sheldon,Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?
14328,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology."
14329,3,22,the staircase improvement,Sheldon,There’s doubt?
14330,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn’t have tried to change it."
14331,3,22,the staircase improvement,Sheldon,"That’s not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right."
14332,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"Okay, I’m sorry."
14333,3,22,the staircase improvement,Sheldon,There you go.
14334,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"So, we’re good?"
14335,3,22,the staircase improvement,Sheldon,Good what?
14336,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?
14337,3,22,the staircase improvement,Sheldon,Go ahead.
14338,3,22,the staircase improvement,Television voice,Up next Babylon 5.
14339,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,You’re not even watching!
14340,3,22,the staircase improvement,Sheldon,I can hear it!
14341,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"Oh, so the dialogue offends you?"
14342,3,22,the staircase improvement,Sheldon,I would hardly call that dialogue!
14343,3,22,the staircase improvement,Leonard,"You’re insane, you know that?!"
14344,3,22,the staircase improvement,Sheldon,"Don’t make me turn that flag upside down, ’cause you know I’ll do it!"
14345,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Okay, we’ve got power to the laser."
14346,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,I should’ve brought an umbrella.
14347,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,What for? It’s not going to rain.
14348,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility."
14349,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"That’s a bazinga, right?"
14350,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"One of my best, don’t you think?"
14351,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility."
14352,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don’t have to peep through windows."
14353,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,"It’s not like that, I’m watching someone’s TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey’s Anatomy."
14354,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?"
14355,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Relax, it’s just a dirty sock."
14356,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?
14357,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks."
14358,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,Not my world.
14359,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Hey, you know who’d really dig seeing this experiment? Penny."
14360,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"I wasn’t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object."
14361,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,Why don’t you ask her to come up?
14362,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"I don’t know, it’s still a little weird since, you know…"
14363,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,She dumped you?
14364,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
14365,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.
14366,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"Oh, it’s very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don’t leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye."
14367,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,Screw you guys. I’m gonna go see if she’s home.
14368,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"If it’s not too much trouble, I’d like to point this at the moon now."
14369,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,"Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something’s very wrong."
14370,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Oh, hi. What’s going on?"
14371,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,We’re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.
14372,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"I’m sorry, what?"
14373,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,It’s pretty cool. We’ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.
14374,3,23,the lunar excitation,Man in Penny’s Apartment,That makes no sense.
14375,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,Um…
14376,3,23,the lunar excitation,Man,How can you bounce stuff off the moon? There’s no gravity.
14377,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard."
14378,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,Hey.
14379,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Oh, sorry, I didn’t know you were busy. Maybe another time."
14380,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Yeah, maybe."
14381,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,"Hey, I want to see this laser thing."
14382,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Oh, but what about the party?"
14383,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,"It’s a surprise party, doesn’t matter when we get there."
14384,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Oh, right."
14385,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how’d you two guys meet?"
14386,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.
14387,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,Your company?
14388,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,"Well,, my dad, but me and my sister are VPs."
14389,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"So, menus."
14390,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,I know it sounds easy but there’s a lot of science that goes in designing them.
14391,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,Happy now? I’m moving the dirty sock.
14392,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one."
14393,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack."
14394,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,Hey.
14395,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,Hello.
14396,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,Whoa! Is that the laser? It’s bitchin’.
14397,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’."
14398,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,"Well, mission accomplished."
14399,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Let me explain what we’re doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we’re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier."
14400,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,Oh! That’s very cool.
14401,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,One question. How can you be sure it won’t blow up?
14402,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,The laser?
14403,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,The moon.
14404,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"See, now this is a man for Penny."
14405,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Uh, that’s a great question, Zack."
14406,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"No, it’s not."
14407,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,Sheldon! Play nice.
14408,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,Well it’s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon? That’s a great question.
14409,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Don’t worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun."
14410,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,Smart.
14411,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Now, we’ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won’t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye."
14412,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,Naked.
14413,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses."
14414,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,"Cool, it’s gonna be in 3-D?"
14415,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,Preparing to fire laser at the moon.
14416,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,Make it so.
14417,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,There it is. There’s the spike!
14418,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,2.5 seconds for the light to return. That’s the moon! We hit the moon!
14419,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,That’s your big experiment? All that for a line on the screen?
14420,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane."
14421,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,What species is that?
14422,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,I was wrong. Penny can do better.
14423,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Okay, guys, thank you, it’s been fun."
14424,3,23,the lunar excitation,Zack,"Yeah, thanks. Should we invite them to the party?"
14425,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"No, just keep walking."
14426,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,He must be very skilled at coitus.
14427,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,"I’m telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores."
14428,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,Horse.
14429,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,What?
14430,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"The phrase is get back on the horse, not whores."
14431,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,"That’s disgusting, dude."
14432,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"No, it’s not… Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found."
14433,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"No, thanks."
14434,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.
14435,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,Have they found a match for you?
14436,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"Tons. I’ve had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left."
14437,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,I can’t bring the nitrogen tank down.
14438,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,Why not?
14439,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"All right, let me restate that. It’s very heavy, and I don’t want to."
14440,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,I’ll help you.
14441,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night."
14442,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
14443,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"Yeah, right."
14444,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,"No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein’s monster was lonely and he found a wife."
14445,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,He didn’t find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.
14446,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,"Okay, we’ll call that plan B."
14447,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,Coming!
14448,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Damn you, you rat bastard."
14449,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,Are you drunk?
14450,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!"
14451,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,How did I ruin him?
14452,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"‘Cause in the olden days, I never would’ve known he was so stupid."
14453,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Come on, he wasn’t that stupid."
14454,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!"
14455,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Okay, yeah, he’s stupid."
14456,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.
14457,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,How is that my fault?
14458,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me."
14459,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,Where are we going?
14460,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,We’re gonna have sex.
14461,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Why? I mean, okay."
14462,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,What’s going on?
14463,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, ’cause it’s gonna get loud."
14464,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,Oh! Not this again.
14465,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny."
14466,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?"
14467,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I’m making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?"
14468,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Oh, thanks, I’m not hungry."
14469,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night."
14470,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Yeah, sorry about that."
14471,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"As a native Texan, I must say I’ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context."
14472,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Oh, God."
14473,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"Oh, God. That I’ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard."
14474,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,How many times have I asked you not to do that?
14475,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,Counting this instance? 317.
14476,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,Where’s Penny?
14477,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.
14478,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,I wonder why she didn’t say good-bye.
14479,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?
14480,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective."
14481,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,I have no difficulty believing you’re not butter.
14482,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Oh, hey."
14483,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift."
14484,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Okay, I’ll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?"
14485,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet."
14486,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie."
14487,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Oh, yeah, tonight’s not great for me."
14488,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,Doesn’t have to be tonight. I’m free pretty much always.
14489,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Leonard, last night was a mistake."
14490,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?"
14491,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Look, I’m sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?"
14492,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"No, it’s pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing."
14493,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Oh, God!"
14494,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"So, that’s it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?"
14495,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Look, I said I’m sorry. Can’t u please let it go?"
14496,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson."
14497,3,23,the lunar excitation,Mrs Gunderson,"Good morning, Leonard. Or should I say yee-haw?"
14498,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,Holy crap.
14499,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,What?
14500,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.
14501,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,Excuse me?
14502,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.
14503,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,You’re kidding. An actual woman?
14504,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,"Yeah, look. Breasts and everything."
14505,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"Trust me, breasts doesn’t necessarily mean woman."
14506,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,Since when?
14507,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"I’ll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon."
14508,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?"
14509,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,Do you know what he’s talking about?
14510,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,Nope. Why don’t you ask him?
14511,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,"Leonard, what are you talking about?"
14512,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,I don’t want to talk about it.
14513,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,That was a lousy suggestion.
14514,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form…"
14515,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it."
14516,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leslie Winkle,Hello?
14517,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie."
14518,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leslie,Leonard Hofstadter. What’re you doing here?
14519,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Uh, I know! It’s been a while!"
14520,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leslie,"Yeah, 18 months."
14521,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,Right. Right. So how you doing?
14522,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leslie,Fine. You?
14523,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn’t mean anything, it was just for fun?"
14524,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leslie,Yeah.
14525,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?"
14526,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leslie,What happened? Blondie dumped you?
14527,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
14528,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leslie,Right.
14529,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Um, anyway, apparently, it’s okay to go back to people you’re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them."
14530,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leslie,Uh-huh.
14531,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"So, what do you say?"
14532,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leslie,Let me think about it.
14533,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,She’s not coming back.
14534,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.
14535,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,Not us. Him.
14536,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,"Yes, but him doesn’t even know about her."
14537,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"Well, him about to find out about her."
14538,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,Really? Us gonna tell him?
14539,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,Who’s going to tell whom about what?
14540,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,Sheldon. Hey.
14541,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,Hi.
14542,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,Your surprise confuses me. I live here.
14543,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?"
14544,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,Be more specific.
14545,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,Four thirty.
14546,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,That’s not afternoon. That’s preevning.
14547,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,What?
14548,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,It’s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.
14549,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,"Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?"
14550,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"Well, tomorrow’s Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I’ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking."
14551,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4 30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?"
14552,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery."
14553,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,"But it’s true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler."
14554,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum."
14555,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"And that’s exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating”"
14556,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,"Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum."
14557,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"Well, come on, where’s your scientific curiosity?"
14558,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it’s wondering why I’m having this conversation with you."
14559,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,"Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years."
14560,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,He didn’t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.
14561,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"Okay, well, why don’t you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later."
14562,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,I don’t drink coffee.
14563,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"All right, you can have a hot chocolate."
14564,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them."
14565,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,Why?
14566,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,What’s life without whimsy?
14567,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"Okay, I’m out."
14568,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,"Sheldon, I’ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever."
14569,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,You’re bluffing.
14570,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,Are you willing to risk it?
14571,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,Curse you.
14572,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,Thirty feet.
14573,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,"Oh. Hey, Leonard."
14574,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!"
14575,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,Are you drunk?
14576,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,"Come on. We’re gonna have sex, and it’s not gonna mean a thing!"
14577,3,23,the lunar excitation,Penny,Are you out of your mind?!
14578,3,23,the lunar excitation,Leonard,I’m really starting to think there’s a double standard here.
14579,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?"
14580,3,23,the lunar excitation,Raj,You don’t know we’re wrong yet.
14581,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,Haughty derision it is.
14582,3,23,the lunar excitation,Amy,Excuse me. I’m Amy Farrah Fowler. You’re Sheldon Cooper.
14583,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I’m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I’m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock."
14584,3,23,the lunar excitation,Amy,"If that was slang, I’m unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I’m here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year."
14585,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.
14586,3,23,the lunar excitation,Amy,"I don’t object to the concept of a deity, but I’m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance."
14587,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,"Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas."
14588,3,23,the lunar excitation,Amy,"Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table."
14589,3,23,the lunar excitation,Sheldon,May I buy you a beverage?
14590,3,23,the lunar excitation,Amy,"Tepid water, please."
14591,3,23,the lunar excitation,Howard,"Good God, what have we done?"
14592,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,And now the kung pao chicken.
14593,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,Alright.
14594,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Raj,Smooth.
14595,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"And finally, my moo shu pork."
14596,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Raj,Whoo-hoo!
14597,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"Ah, there you have it, gentlemen. Our entire dinner unpacked by robot."
14598,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Raj,And it only took 28 minutes.
14599,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Impressive, but we must be cautious."
14600,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,Why?
14601,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Today, it’s a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor."
14602,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,"I don’t think that’s going to happen, Sheldon."
14603,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,No one ever does. That’s why it happens.
14604,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Hey. Is the food here? Ooh. What’s that?
14605,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"That, dear lady, is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand, designed for extravehicular repairs on the International Space Station."
14606,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Ah, cool."
14607,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,Ask me to pass the soy sauce.
14608,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Oh, does that come up much on the space station?"
14609,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.
14610,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,All right. Pass the soy sauce.
14611,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,Coming up.
14612,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,So how’s work?
14613,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Oh, it’s not bad. Kind of hungry."
14614,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,"Yeah, we all are."
14615,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,Just wait.
14616,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"You realize, Penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete."
14617,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Really? They’re going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?
14618,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,I thought you broke up with her. Why is she here?
14619,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"Okay, here we go. Passing the soy sauce. Put out your hand."
14620,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Oh ha-ha, oh. That’s amazing."
14621,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"I wouldn’t say amazing. At best, it’s a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree."
14622,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"Hey, Sheldon?"
14623,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Yes?
14624,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Peace?
14625,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"No, not peace. Hang on."
14626,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Does NASA know you’re using that thing as a napkin holder?
14627,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,You kidding? They still think it’s in a secure locker at JPL.
14628,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,You stole it?
14629,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,Borrowed. The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.
14630,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Excuse me. Oh. Amy’s at the dry cleaners, and she’s made a very amusing pun. “I don’t care for perchloroethylene, and I don’t like glycol ether.” Get it? She doesn’t like glycol ether. Sounds like either."
14631,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,L-O-L.
14632,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Who’s Amy?
14633,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,His girlfriend.
14634,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Sheldon has a girlfriend?
14635,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
14636,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,How long has this been going on?
14637,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,Four months.
14638,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
14639,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Are you telling me, for the past four months I have been asking you what’s new and you never thought to go with Sheldon has a girlfriend?"
14640,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
14641,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Ah, du-du-du-du-du. How did they meet?"
14642,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"Raj and I entered Sheldon’s information on a dating site, and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler."
14643,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy."
14644,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"Or, as we call them, Shamy."
14645,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Shamy. I am so digging the Shamy.
14646,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"All right, everyone pay attention. Yes, I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, she is female. Yes, we communicate on a daily basis, but no, she is not my girlfriend."
14647,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Okay, well, what do you communicate about?"
14648,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together."
14649,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Thank you.
14650,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,Wait a minute– a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now you’re considering having a baby?
14651,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior, benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow."
14652,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,I’m guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.
14653,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Okay, I have a question."
14654,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Yes, Penny."
14655,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,You don’t even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?
14656,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Why on Earth would we have sex?
14657,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? You know, when your private parts started growing?"
14658,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"I’m quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity."
14659,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Oh, God."
14660,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Yes, exactly. Consequently, if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. Which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. Is your womb available for rental?"
14661,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,Still digging the Shamy?
14662,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Look, Sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about, uh gee, I don’t know, maybe actually spending some time with her."
14663,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,You mean dating?
14664,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Yeah.
14665,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,I can’t date Amy.
14666,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Why not?
14667,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
14668,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Okay, look, don’t think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child."
14669,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Oh. I hadn’t considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you don’t think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?
14670,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Probably not.
14671,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Huh. It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.
14672,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny."
14673,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.
14674,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.
14675,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Yeah, my point is it’s a waste of time."
14676,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"If you’re looking for an example of a waste of time, I would refer you to the conversation we’re having right now."
14677,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,What do you want?
14678,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,I’ve decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.
14679,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Oh, that’s great. Have fun."
14680,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Wait. You have to drive me.
14681,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,What?
14682,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,You know I don’t drive.
14683,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Well, go ask Leonard."
14684,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"I did. He said, and I quote, ask Penny, it was her cockamamie idea."
14685,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Leonard said cockamamie?
14686,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Actually, I’m paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household, I’m uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, I’m not entirely comfortable with cockamamie."
14687,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Okay, fine. When’s the date?"
14688,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Now.
14689,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Now?
14690,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Hurry. We’re going to be late.
14691,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?"
14692,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,I’m sorry. Do you have other plans?
14693,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Well, no, not per se, but…"
14694,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?
14695,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Let me get my cockamamie keys.
14696,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"Oh, God, that feels so good. Yeah, that’s the spot. Oh, baby."
14697,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Mrs Wolowitz,"Howard, dinner’s ready!"
14698,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"I’ll eat later. I’m busy! Oh, yeah. Just like a real hand. Hmm."
14699,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Thank you for driving me.
14700,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,You’re welcome.
14701,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,I wish you weren’t wearing flip-flops. It’s dangerous to drive in flip-flops.
14702,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Sheldon.
14703,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Sorry. I just don’t want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.
14704,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Can I ask you a question?
14705,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible."
14706,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Yeah. Well, my question is, and I’m pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?"
14707,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?
14708,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,No.
14709,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Then, this is my first date."
14710,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Okay. Well, then, there’s a couple of things you should probably know."
14711,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"I have a master’s degree and two doctorates. The things I should know, I do know."
14712,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me."
14713,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?"
14714,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Fair point.
14715,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Raj,"You know, there’s something I’ve always wondered about Aquaman."
14716,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,Yeah?
14717,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Raj,Where does he poop?
14718,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,What?
14719,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Raj,"What would a toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?"
14720,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,"Hold that thought. Hey, Howard, what’s going on? What? Hold on, Howard, Howard, slow down. The robot hand is stuck on your what?"
14721,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,You’re not going to believe this.
14722,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me you’re a neuro something-or-other."
14723,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Amy,Neurobiologist. Your check engine light is on.
14724,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Yeah, it’s okay."
14725,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Amy,But the light indicates…
14726,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Don’t bother. I’ve wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.
14727,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Um, what is that scent you’re wearing? It smells great."
14728,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Amy,Dandruff shampoo. I have dry scalp.
14729,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Ah. Well, your hair looks very nice."
14730,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Amy,Are you a homosexual?
14731,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"No, no, I was just giving you a compliment."
14732,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Amy,Hmm. Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.
14733,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Guys, how ’bout some music?"
14734,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Oh, no, I wouldn’t care for that. Amy?"
14735,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Amy,"No, thank you."
14736,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?"
14737,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,No.
14738,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Well, why don’t you tell her?"
14739,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,All right. It was hell.
14740,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Any follow up, Amy?"
14741,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Amy,No.
14742,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs."
14743,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?"
14744,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,I don’t know. I was just trying something.
14745,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Muggles.
14746,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Raj,You slipped and fell into a robot hand?
14747,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,Yes.
14748,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Raj,Penis first?
14749,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"Yes. Now, help me!"
14750,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,"I’d suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well."
14751,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"Not funny, Leonard."
14752,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Raj,"Really? A robot hand’s got a death grip on your junk, dude. That’s funny, ask anyone."
14753,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"Please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!"
14754,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,"Okay, let’s see."
14755,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"No, no! Don’t touch, the program is paused."
14756,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,"Well, then let’s un-pause it."
14757,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks it’s holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, it’s gonna start twisting."
14758,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Raj,"A-All right, um, how about this. When, when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled."
14759,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,"You do what you want, I’m not touching another man’s honey tree."
14760,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Raj,"All right, uh, forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?"
14761,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,What? No saws! One circumcision was enough.
14762,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,How about an acetylene torch?
14763,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"Okay, I can’t believe this needs to be said out loud. No pulling, no saws, no torches."
14764,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,"Well, then what do you want us to do?"
14765,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,I…
14766,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Mrs Wolowitz,"Howard, I made cookies for you and your little friends!"
14767,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"That’s great, Mom, thanks!"
14768,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Mrs Wolowitz,I’ll bring them up with some Hawaiian Punch!
14769,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,Don’t come up here!
14770,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Mrs Wolowitz,Why not?! Are you ashamed of your mother?!
14771,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"Yes, but that’s not the point! Get me out of here."
14772,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,"You have any ideas, Raj?"
14773,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Raj,"Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch."
14774,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Hey, here’s another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?"
14775,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. It’s over 14 hours in Southern California.
14776,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Amy,That’s an amusing factoid.
14777,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Thank you.
14778,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon’s first official date. Discuss."
14779,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Amy,Is this true?
14780,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn’t count."
14781,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"So, um, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?"
14782,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Amy,"Once a year. It’s a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?"
14783,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Uh, yeah, I wouldn’t say many. A few."
14784,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.
14785,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,What? Where did you get 171 men?
14786,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Simple extrapolation. In the three years that I’ve known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15…"
14787,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15."
14788,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,I’m sorry. 16?
14789,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,14.
14790,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"My mistake. Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. Plus or minus eight men."
14791,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Amy,Remarkable. Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?
14792,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,No.
14793,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.
14794,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Oh.
14795,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Based on the number of awkward encounters I’ve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she’s returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before…"
14796,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Okay, Sheldon, I think you’ve made your point."
14797,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Let’s round that up to 31."
14798,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. I’m gonna need a drink over here."
14799,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Amy,"This is very interesting. Cultural perceptions are subjective. Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?"
14800,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"No! No! No. Let’s just all finish our dinners, okay?"
14801,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?
14802,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Amy,Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?
14803,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,I should think so.
14804,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Amy,Then 128.
14805,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,"Okay, come on. Almost there."
14806,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,Don’t tug. No tugging.
14807,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Raj,"Next time, take your own advice."
14808,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,"Excuse me, could you help us out?"
14809,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Nurse,"My, my, my. What do we have here?"
14810,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,I slipped and fell.
14811,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Nurse,"Yeah, we get that a lot. What is this?"
14812,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,It’s a robot arm.
14813,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Nurse,Where’s the rest of the robot?
14814,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,I only built the arm.
14815,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Nurse,"‘Cause that’s all you needed, right?"
14816,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,Can you please just help me?
14817,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Nurse,"All right, all right. Hang on, stay calm."
14818,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Nurse,I need an orderly with a wheelchair. I got a robot hand grasping a man’s penis out here.
14819,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,You think you could be a little more discreet?
14820,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Nurse,"I’m sorry, we don’t have a code for robot hand grasping a man’s penis. Why is it hooked up to a computer?"
14821,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,"Uh, it’s what controls the arm."
14822,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,But it’s frozen.
14823,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Nurse,Did you try turning it off and back on again?
14824,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"No, you see, it’s more complicated than that."
14825,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,"No, wait!"
14826,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Howard,Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.
14827,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Raj,Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?
14828,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,You were right. This was a very productive evening. I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.
14829,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,I did not have sex with 31 guys.
14830,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"I’ll be happy to check the math, but numbers don’t lie, Penny. In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together, I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship."
14831,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,And that is?
14832,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.
14833,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,You’re still on that?
14834,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"In these uncertain times, doesn’t humanity deserve a gift?"
14835,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"Okay, you know what? I’m gonna come at this in a whole new way. Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish, I’m gonna tell your mother on you."
14836,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,That’s no threat. My mother’s always wanted a grandchild.
14837,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?
14838,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,Curses.
14839,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Penny,"If I’d thought of that in the first place, I could’ve saved myself this whole night."
14840,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,"Well, it’s not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night."
14841,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,"Hey, Howard, what’s up?"
14842,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Sheldon,I’ve decided not to procreate.
14843,4,1,the robotic manipulation,Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, great. Howard, uh, slow down. What do you mean it happened again?"
14844,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Whatcha doin’ there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?
14845,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?
14846,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Yes.
14847,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?
14848,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Yes.
14849,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,What I’m doing here is trying to determine when I’m going to die.
14850,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?
14851,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera."
14852,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What’s KBB?
14853,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,Killed by badger.
14854,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,How’s that?
14855,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there’s a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us."
14856,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,I don’t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.
14857,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who’s to say that I don’t share that flawed DNA?"
14858,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,You can always get a badger and find out.
14859,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left."
14860,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"That long, huh?"
14861,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.
14862,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,What’s there?
14863,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality."
14864,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"So, you’re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?"
14865,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,By this much.
14866,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Tough break. You want eggs?
14867,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"You don’t get it, Leonard. I’m going to miss so much, the unified field theory,  cold fusion, the dogapus."
14868,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,What’s a dogapus?
14869,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,A hybrid dog and octopus. Man’s underwater best friend.
14870,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Is somebody working on that?
14871,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.
14872,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Wait a minute. You hate dogs.
14873,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.
14874,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Howard,What do we owe you?
14875,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,It came to $28.17. Let’s say six bucks apiece.
14876,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Howard,Here you go.
14877,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Thank you.
14878,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,What?
14879,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Never mind. I got it.
14880,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Oh, you wanted me to pay."
14881,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,It’s no big deal.
14882,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"No, no, no, no. You’re right. We’re not going out anymore, I should pay for myself."
14883,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,What?
14884,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Howard,"He said if he had woman parts, he’d eat for free the rest of his life."
14885,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to talk to yourself. I’m a little low on cash."
14886,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Hmm? How much you got?
14887,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,Nothing.
14888,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,How can you walk around with no money?
14889,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,I’m cute. I get by.
14890,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"It’s okay, you can owe me."
14891,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,Okay.
14892,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"Sheldon, six bucks."
14893,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"No, thank you. I’m not eating pizza tonight."
14894,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,But it’s Thursday. Thursday’s pizza night.
14895,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight’s selection, brussels sprouts."
14896,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Howard,Really? You’re changing the Sheldonian calendar?
14897,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,It’s a small price to pay.
14898,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,For what?
14899,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"No, no, don’t ask."
14900,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry."
14901,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet."
14902,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?"
14903,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,Correct.
14904,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?
14905,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"Essentially, yes."
14906,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Okay, here’s my question. Didn’t you already do that?"
14907,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"Flattering, but sadly, no. I’m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging."
14908,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?"
14909,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"Certainly. I’ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test."
14910,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Howard,"You’re right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together."
14911,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"That’s an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster."
14912,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"No, it won’t. Um, how does he know I jog?"
14913,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Howard,"Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars."
14914,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Oh, my God, that is so creepy!"
14915,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Howard,I know!
14916,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Howard,And he says he’s not gonna stop.
14917,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Howard,Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.
14918,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,Ugh.
14919,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,U-u-ugh.
14920,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,Lenu-u-ugh.
14921,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,What the hell? What’s the matter?
14922,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I’m nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.
14923,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"There’s no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena."
14924,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"Well, if it’s not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung’s Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms."
14925,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
14926,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"It’s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!"
14927,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Have you had your appendix out?
14928,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"I haven’t. I’ve been meaning to, but who has the time?"
14929,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Let’s get you to the hospital.
14930,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?"
14931,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,No.
14932,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,I do. And yet I’m doomed while you live on.
14933,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"Funny how things work out, isn’t it?"
14934,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, I think it’s about to burst!"
14935,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts."
14936,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Good night.
14937,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.
14938,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny."
14939,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees."
14940,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,Thank you. They’re my mother’s.
14941,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you’re gonna run really fast?
14942,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"No, the Flash shirt is because it’s Friday, but it’s nice when things work out. Where’s your heart rate monitor?"
14943,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,I don’t have one.
14944,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,What about your pedometer?
14945,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,Don’t have one.
14946,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?
14947,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Uh, no."
14948,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?"
14949,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"No. I just run till I’m hungry, then I stop for a bear claw."
14950,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,Why are you doing that?
14951,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,It’s good to stretch your muscles before you run.
14952,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,All right.
14953,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"All right, let’s start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it."
14954,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,I am doing it.
14955,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?"
14956,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,We’ll never know.
14957,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Okay, let’s just warm up on the run."
14958,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,Okay.
14959,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Okay, let’s go."
14960,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"Yeah, I’ve been reading up on biomechanics. I think you’ll be surprised at my… Wah! Oh!"
14961,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Oh, my God, are you okay?"
14962,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,I think so.
14963,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Oh, let me help you up."
14964,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,Thank you.
14965,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Oh, Sheldon!"
14966,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night."
14967,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"Here’s my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani."
14968,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Howard,"Thank you, sir."
14969,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"Palak paneer, that’s Penny."
14970,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,Thanks.
14971,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets."
14972,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Hey, what’s my share?"
14973,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"Uh, 12 bucks."
14974,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?"
14975,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Sure.
14976,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,What am I up to now?
14977,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars."
14978,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,What now?
14979,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Howard,He’s just expressing his admiration that you don’t even have to put out to get free stuff.
14980,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"It’s not free, I’m gonna pay him back."
14981,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,Shut up!
14982,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"Sheldon, are you gonna join us?"
14983,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,Coming!
14984,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"Greetings, friends."
14985,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"Greetings, whatever the hell you are."
14986,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner."
14987,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Howard,Really? That’s your question? When did he put a ramp in?
14988,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"You’re in my spot. This may seem a little odd at first, but over time you’ll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration."
14989,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Yeah, to be honest, I don’t see much difference."
14990,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"Thank you. That’s what I was going for. Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you’ll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces."
14991,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,This is ridiculous. I’m coming to talk to you.
14992,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"You don’t know where I am. My physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location."
14993,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,You’re in your bedroom.
14994,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"No, I’m not."
14995,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.
14996,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"No, you can’t. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized personnel only!"
14997,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks."
14998,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"Sheldon, this is ridiculous."
14999,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,I’m behind you. Please look at me when you’re talking to me.
15000,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,I am looking at you.
15001,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"No, you’re not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed."
15002,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God."
15003,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"At my age, do you know how I’m statistically most likely to die?"
15004,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,At the hands of your roommate?
15005,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,An accident.
15006,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,That’s how I’m going to make it look.
15007,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed."
15008,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"Fine, but don’t expect my help."
15009,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"You have to help, it’s in the roommate agreement."
15010,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"No, it’s not."
15011,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.
15012,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,I’ll be damned.
15013,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,This is delightful.
15014,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Uh-huh.
15015,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,It’s much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death.
15016,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Refresh my memory. Why didn’t I just put you in the trunk?
15017,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,Because I called shotgun. Remember?
15018,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Right.
15019,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,You seem tense. Perhaps this will relax you.
15020,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"I don’t want to listen to music, Sheldon."
15021,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"Very well. I don’t understand why you’re not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we’re like Knight Rider."
15022,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"Except in Knight Rider, the car isn’t a yammering sphincter."
15023,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"You mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn’t survive. There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?"
15024,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider."
15025,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,Perhaps you’d be interested in a different game.
15026,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,No.
15027,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"This is a photograph of the 1911 Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. Using Photoshop, I’ve introduced a few anachronisms. See if you can spot all 24. I’ll give you the first one. Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch. And go."
15028,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,That’s it. Bye-bye.
15029,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,Bazinga.
15030,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Whoa!
15031,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,I have an override switch.
15032,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,I almost died!
15033,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,And I’m safe and sound in bed. Who’s crazy now?
15034,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,I’m still going to go with you.
15035,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"Hello, Professor Hoskins. Nice to see you, Mindy. Konichi-wa Dr. Nakamora. Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory. Leonard, my door."
15036,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,What about it?
15037,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,Be a lamb and open it for me.
15038,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Why? What’s the problem?
15039,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"You think you have me stymied, don’t you?"
15040,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"No, I think a doorknob has you stymied."
15041,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Howard,"Oh, look, it’s Leonard and R2-D-Bag."
15042,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Raj,That’s my joke. I told it last night. You can’t just use it.
15043,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"Raj, be a lamb and open the door for me."
15044,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Raj,"Oh, sure."
15045,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,He’s a lamb. You’re not.
15046,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Raj,I’m a lamb.
15047,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,Isn’t this nice? The pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin.
15048,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Howard,I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.
15049,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Raj,"That’s two, dude. Write your own jokes."
15050,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Oh, great. Hi, I’m Penny, I’ll be your waitress."
15051,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Why are you introducing yourself?
15052,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,I’d rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.
15053,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,Can you tell me the specials this evening?
15054,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Sheldon, I’m not waiting on you."
15055,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,Obviously. I don’t even have water yet.
15056,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,Because you’re not here.
15057,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"That’s discrimination against the otherwise located. I’m going to have to go over your head. Manager, manager. Oh, Lord, look who it is."
15058,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Howard,Is that Steve Wozniak?
15059,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,I think it is.
15060,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,The Great and Powerful Woz.
15061,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,"Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it…"
15062,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Yeah, I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars."
15063,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,I must speak to him.
15064,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Leonard,Of course you must.
15065,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"You know, there’s an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime."
15066,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?"
15067,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Steve Wozniak,"Oh, hey. Nice virtual presence device."
15068,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,Thank you. I just want to say I’m a big fan. You’re my fifteenth favourite technological visionary.
15069,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Steve Wozniak,Only fifteenth?
15070,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,It’s still six spots above Steve Jobs. I care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.
15071,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Steve Wozniak,"Yeah, I never got that turtleneck thing."
15072,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple Two. Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement."
15073,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Steve Wozniak,"Thanks, we were shooting for nifty. You know, if you had it here, I’d autograph it for you."
15074,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"Don’t move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running."
15075,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Steve Wozniak,Nerds.
15076,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,"I’m coming, Woz, I’m coming."
15077,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon,Ow! Aw.
15078,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,"Penny, Penny, Penny."
15079,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"What up, Shel-Bot?"
15080,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,I can’t get out of bed. I hurt my ankle.
15081,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,What do you want me to do?
15082,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,Sing me Soft Kitty.
15083,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?"
15084,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?
15085,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur."
15086,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,Closer to the microphone.
15087,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Happy kitty, sleepy…"
15088,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Sheldon-bot,No. You have to start over.
15089,4,2,the cruciferous vegetable amplification,Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
15090,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"All right, I’m ready for my next question."
15091,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,"In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the Second World War?"
15092,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Uganda.
15093,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Defend.
15094,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. A Central African power block is formed, colonizing North Africa and Europe. When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs."
15095,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Correct. My turn.
15096,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument, on what does Scott Joplin play The Maple Leaf Rag?"
15097,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Tuned bayonets.
15098,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Defend.
15099,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Isn’t it obvious?
15100,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,You’re right. My apologies.
15101,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,What the hell are you guys playing?
15102,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,It’s a game we invented. It’s called Counterfactuals.
15103,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.
15104,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,It’s fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.
15105,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.
15106,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"You’re in luck, this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?"
15107,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don’t know."
15108,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Leonard, be serious. We’re playing a game here."
15109,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"I can figure this out, let’s see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I’ll say cinnamon."
15110,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish."
15111,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,What?
15112,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,"In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?"
15113,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,This is ridiculous. You’re just making stuff up.
15114,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Is he always like this when he loses?
15115,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. You should’ve been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008."
15116,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,You bumped the table and you know it.
15117,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. We’ll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.
15118,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,I’m going to my room.
15119,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,"Very good, Leonard. But next time, don’t tell us where you’re hiding."
15120,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? It’s pretty interesting. This guy’s working from a hypothesis where…
15121,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.
15122,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,What?
15123,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,"Don’t ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty."
15124,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,"On the potty? What are you, five?"
15125,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,It’s a potty. What do you call it?
15126,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,Toilet.
15127,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,"That’s a little vulgar for the dinner table, don’t you think?"
15128,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,"Oh, and potty is okay?"
15129,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.
15130,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,"What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?"
15131,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,If I don’t have to boom-boom.
15132,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.
15133,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,Sure.
15134,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,Nice to see you.
15135,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Hello.
15136,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Sorry we’re late.
15137,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,I must take responsibility. I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.
15138,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,"Ah, ah."
15139,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,Okay.
15140,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,I believe she’s experiencing her menses.
15141,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,"Actually, I’m not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time."
15142,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Ah, ah."
15143,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,"Okay. Toilet’s sounding pretty good now, huh?"
15144,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,"Hey, look, it’s Shamy."
15145,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Shamy?
15146,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy,  Shamy."
15147,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Oh. I don’t like that. Don’t do that.
15148,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,All righty. What’s new?
15149,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,"Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy, and I don’t like that."
15150,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,"I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how’s your life?"
15151,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,"Like everybody else’s. Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking. Why is she not taking our order?"
15152,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"I should’ve warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here."
15153,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Really? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.
15154,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,It’s how they lure you in. I believe it’s called bait and switch.
15155,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,"Okay, I’m just gonna walk away, ’cause I don’t want to be here."
15156,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"So, this is nice. First time we’ve all gotten together to eat."
15157,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,"You’re right, he’s a festival of humdrum chitchat."
15158,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Okay, that’s all I got. Howard, you’re up."
15159,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,"Um, tell us about your work, Amy."
15160,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,I doubt you’d understand. Sheldon tells me you only have a master’s degree.
15161,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,"Raj, do you have any questions for Amy?"
15162,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,I’m curious as to why we’re not eating alone.
15163,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,They can’t function without me. I’m the social glue that holds this little group together. You’re welcome.
15164,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?"
15165,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"She’s not my girlfriend. She’s a girl and she’s my friend, but there’s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva."
15166,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,Got it.
15167,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. It’s an action we both regret to this day."
15168,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Uh-huh. Anyway, I’m not sure she’s the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance."
15169,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars, I’ve always been more of an empire man."
15170,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Yeah, not my point."
15171,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"I know what your point is. You’re intimidated by Amy’s intellect. To that I say, buck up."
15172,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious."
15173,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,So?
15174,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,So we already have you for all that.
15175,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?
15176,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else."
15177,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore."
15178,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,Suffered in silence?
15179,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Yes. And I’d thank you to do the same.
15180,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,Really? Silence?
15181,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,"Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?"
15182,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,Philadelphia.
15183,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,Really? I thought they were out West someplace.
15184,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,"Think about it, Raj. Where did the movie Rocky take place?"
15185,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,"Philadelphia. Okay, now I get it."
15186,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,"So this is the plan? From now on, we’re just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?"
15187,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,"I’m very comfortable here. Penny, dear, why don’t you shoot another silver bullet my way?"
15188,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,Get one yourself.
15189,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,"Ooh, somebody’s been taking bitchy pills."
15190,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,"God, he’s an ass when he drinks."
15191,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,"Oh, he’s an ass when he doesn’t. You just don’t hear it."
15192,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.
15193,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,"Well, if that’s the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place."
15194,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.
15195,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,I did.
15196,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,"Well, what’d he say?"
15197,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you."
15198,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,"Kinda, sorta had to?"
15199,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,I didn’t agree with him.
15200,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,"Well, you defended me, right?"
15201,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"I tried, but he made a fairly well-reasoned argument."
15202,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,You’re not doing that right.
15203,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,What?
15204,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,Gimme.
15205,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,No.
15206,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,Trust me.
15207,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,No!
15208,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,I do this for my mom all the time. See? With the grain.
15209,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,"Wow, that is better."
15210,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,"And someday, when you have varicose veins, I’ll show you how to massage them."
15211,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,"Oh, God, never again."
15212,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"I assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of Penny’s beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks."
15213,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,I was homesick.
15214,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,The highlight of the evening was when you showed us your Bollywood break dancing skills.
15215,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,That’s very offensive.
15216,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,"Yeah, we all thought so."
15217,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Oh, no."
15218,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,What?
15219,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,John and Yoko.
15220,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,More like Yoko and Yoko.
15221,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Greetings.
15222,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,Hey.
15223,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I’m doing.
15224,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,"It’s very impressive, for theoretical work."
15225,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Do I detect a hint of condescension?
15226,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,"I’m sorry, was I being too subtle? I meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, what’s the word I’m looking for? Hmm, cute."
15227,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard and Howard together,Oooh!
15228,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?
15229,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,I’m stating it outright. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.
15230,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,You take that back.
15231,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,"Absolutely not. My colleagues and I are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi. That means it’s better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours."
15232,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"I’m sorry, I’m-I’m still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so…"
15233,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology."
15234,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,"Yes, but if I’m successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm."
15235,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"That’s the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!"
15236,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,We appear to have reached an impasse.
15237,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately.
15238,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Seconded.
15239,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,There being no objections…
15240,4,3,the zazzy substitution,All,"No, uh-uh."
15241,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"The motion carries. Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler."
15242,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,"Good day, Sheldon Cooper."
15243,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,"Women, huh? Can’t live with them, can’t successfully refute their hypotheses."
15244,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Amen to that.
15245,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
15246,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Hello.
15247,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,I hear you broke up with Amy.
15248,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.
15249,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,"Wow. That’s like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?"
15250,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Regarding what?
15251,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,Amy.
15252,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,I don’t follow.
15253,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,"Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough."
15254,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Penny, I assure you, I’m fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility, and I’m continuing on with my life as before."
15255,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Penny,Okay. Good.
15256,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to buy a pussycat."
15257,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"I gotta tell you guys, I’m a little worried about Sheldon."
15258,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,We’re all a little worried about Sheldon.
15259,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef."
15260,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,"Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization, you know, I’m worried about Sheldon someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O."
15261,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,What does hit a reef mean?
15262,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Uh, went splitsville."
15263,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,Pardon?
15264,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,Turned to boom-boom.
15265,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,Ah.
15266,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,I think Sheldon really misses Amy.
15267,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.
15268,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,He got a cat to keep him company.
15269,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,You’re kidding.
15270,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"He takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom."
15271,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,He takes the kitty to the potty?
15272,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,I thought we discussed the P-word.
15273,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,"Don’t try to change me, dude. I am what I am."
15274,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Oh, gentlemen."
15275,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,Hey. Aren’t you going to introduce us to your little friend?
15276,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"My apologies. Raj, Howard, I’d like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer."
15277,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,Hello.
15278,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Raj,Hi.
15279,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Now, if you’ll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk."
15280,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Howard,"Okay, I get it. We’re worried about Sheldon."
15281,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,Yeah.
15282,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,Hey.
15283,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Oh, no."
15284,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.
15285,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?
15286,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Edward Teller, Otto Frisch, and Zazzles."
15287,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,Zazzles?
15288,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz, but he’s so zazzy."
15289,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Okay, we need to talk."
15290,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,About what?
15291,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Cats, Sheldon. You’re clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you’re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats."
15292,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Clowder.
15293,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,What?
15294,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.
15295,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Okay, yeah, fine."
15296,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,It’s the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.
15297,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you’re feeling with this breakup.
15298,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,It wasn’t a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.
15299,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Okay, I got it, I got it, she’s not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell."
15300,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"You didn’t break up, she dumped you."
15301,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,She didn’t dump me. It was mutual!
15302,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,I was there. She dumped you.
15303,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her."
15304,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"You don’t have to sell me on cats, Leonard. I’m already a fan. All right, fellas, who’s in the mood for Fancy Feast? Well, that’s not fancy at all."
15305,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming."
15306,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,Where is he?
15307,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,He’s in his bedroom.
15308,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,"Now, when you said on the phone he broke up with a girl, you meant an actual girl, not something you kids whipped up in a lab?"
15309,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"No, she’s real."
15310,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,Did they sin?
15311,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"No, no, it’s not like that. It’s, uh, I don’t know what it’s like. But there is something I should prepare you for."
15312,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, relax, Leonard, I have raised that boy. I’ve seen him at his best, I’ve seen him at his worst. There’s nothing he can do that’ll surprise me."
15313,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,Hold on to that thought.
15314,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Come in.
15315,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,Surprise.
15316,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Mom, what an unexpected pleasure."
15317,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,"My, my, that’s a powerful smell."
15318,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"I’d like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf…"
15319,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,"Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats and you gave ’em cute Jewish names."
15320,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,What are you doing here?
15321,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,"Leonard called, and he said that you were pining for a young lady."
15322,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Oh, that’s preposterous. I’m not pining over anyone."
15323,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, lambchop, we can quibble what to call it, but I think we can both agree it’s creepy."
15324,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"I do not agree. Cats make wonderful companions. They don’t argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, I think you’ll find to be quite zazzy."
15325,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,You should have called sooner.
15326,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,Shelly! Dinner’s ready!
15327,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Coming!
15328,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,No cats!
15329,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Aw.
15330,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,What is she doing here?
15331,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,I called her.
15332,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,"Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. As a neurobiologist, I was curious."
15333,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties."
15334,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,25 cats!
15335,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, God bless you, dear. Sheldon, sit down. Let’s talk."
15336,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"All right, but you’re not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen."
15337,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,Then stop talking.
15338,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Yes, ma’am."
15339,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,"Now, the reason I called Amy over was to find out what type of person she is. And after chatting a bit, I have to say that while she is a perfectly unique young woman, you two are definitely not suited for each other."
15340,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"That’s a peculiar conclusion. By any standard, Amy is more similar to me than anyone I’ve ever met."
15341,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, I’m sorry, Shelly, I can’t see it."
15342,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can’t see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they’re there."
15343,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Excellent point.
15344,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,A physics point.
15345,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Touche.
15346,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,"Well, putting aside the pig Latin, it’s a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship so I didn’t have to end it for you."
15347,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Amy, after consideration, I believe we may have acted rashly. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences."
15348,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,I’ll agree to that only if you’ll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.
15349,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,I’ll go as high as 40.
15350,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Sixty-five.
15351,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Done. You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?"
15352,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,I do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.
15353,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,Would you like to see my cats?
15354,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,I would. I love cats. They’re the epitome of indifference.
15355,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying."
15356,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,I saw what you did there.
15357,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,"He thinks he’s such a smarty pants. He’s no different from any man. You tell ’em not to do something, that’s all they want to do. If I hadn’t told my brother Stumpy not to clear out the wood chipper by hand, we’d still be calling him Edward. Now, don’t you move. I’ll bring over all the food."
15358,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Leonard,"No, no, no, I can do it."
15359,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Mrs Cooper,"Well, isn’t that sweet?"
15360,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Thank you, Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20."
15361,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Next!
15362,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Sheldon,"Thank you, Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20."
15363,4,3,the zazzy substitution,Amy,Next!
15364,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,"I’m telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong."
15365,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,"Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you’d be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic."
15366,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,"Oh, you’re so arrogant. If you were a superhero, your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance."
15367,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,"You’re wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto."
15368,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.
15369,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice."
15370,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,Has it occurred to you you’re missing the big picture? If you look at neutron scattering data…
15371,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,"Oh, Penny? Penny?"
15372,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,What’s up?
15373,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.
15374,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"No, no, no. He won. Suck it up."
15375,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Well, I’d ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn’t eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn’t tell me. Howard won’t order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard’s lactose intolerant, so he can’t eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal."
15376,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.
15377,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,You want the fruit platter?
15378,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,Does it have melon on it?
15379,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,Yeah.
15380,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,"No, I can’t eat melon."
15381,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift."
15382,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,When was the last time you saw her?
15383,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Oh, not since we broke up. Wow. How am I going to play this? Sophisticated and relaxed? Friendly, noncommittal? Cold and distant?"
15384,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,"Hi, guys."
15385,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,Hey.
15386,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.
15387,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,It’s one of his best moves.
15388,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"So, my dear, we meet again."
15389,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Katee Sackhoff,"Hello, Howard. I’ve missed you."
15390,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"I’ve missed you, Katee Sackhoff."
15391,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Katee Sackhoff,One question.
15392,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Anything.
15393,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Katee Sackhoff,Why am I wearing my Battlestar Galactica flight suit in bed?
15394,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Why are you in bed with me? If we start to question this, it all falls apart."
15395,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Katee Sackhoff,"Sorry. Oh, ravish me, Howard. My loins ache for you."
15396,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Okay, if you insist."
15397,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Mrs Wolowitz,"Howard, have you seen my girdle?!"
15398,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"No, Ma!"
15399,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Mrs Wolowitz,"I can’t find it, and I’m late for my Weight Watchers meeting!"
15400,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Maybe it committed suicide! Leave me alone! Now, where were we?"
15401,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,I believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.
15402,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Bernadette? What are you doing here?
15403,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Katee Sackhoff,"Well, if I had to guess, I’d say I’m here because you saw me earlier this evening, and you’re still hung up on me."
15404,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"No, I’m not."
15405,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,"Clearly you are. Otherwise, based on past experience, we’d be done by now."
15406,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Okay, I’m a little confused here."
15407,4,4,the hot troll deviation,George Takei,"Oh, my. Can I help?"
15408,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Not that kind of confused.
15409,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,What’s George Takei doing here?
15410,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Katee Sackhoff,"Howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies?"
15411,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"No, of course not."
15412,4,4,the hot troll deviation,George Takei,"So you say. Yet, here I am."
15413,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Katee Sackhoff,"George, let me ask you something. How did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon?"
15414,4,4,the hot troll deviation,George Takei,"It’s difficult. You try and stretch as an actor, do Strindberg, O’Neill, but all they want is, Course laid in, Captain."
15415,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Katee Sackhoff,Tell me about it. It’s frackin’ frustrating.
15416,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?"
15417,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,She’s leaving because you really want to be with me.
15418,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Mrs Wolowitz,"Howard, I found my girdle! It was in the dryer!"
15419,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Great, Ma!"
15420,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Mrs Wolowitz,I think it shrunk! I’m spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!
15421,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"And with that mental picture, I think we’re done for the evening."
15422,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,"You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette."
15423,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,I did a stupid thing.
15424,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,"Yeah, I guessed that."
15425,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.
15426,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,"That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh, my God. You ran over a hobo."
15427,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,No. Stop asking.
15428,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,"All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her, but you’re too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did."
15429,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,In a nutshell.
15430,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,"Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn’t know it’s you."
15431,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Now, you see, I don’t know if you’re kidding or not."
15432,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,You’re being unreasonable. Why can’t I have a desk?
15433,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don’t need desks.
15434,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,You have a desk.
15435,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Correct.
15436,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,But I can’t have one.
15437,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,You’re two for two.
15438,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,"Why can’t he have a desk, Sheldon?"
15439,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I’ve explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it’s convenient, there’s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture."
15440,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,"Oh, but there’s money for a drawer full of Red Vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?"
15441,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Yes.
15442,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Okay, what if he buys his own desk?"
15443,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,"Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?"
15444,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,That’s ridiculous.
15445,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Why?
15446,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Because…
15447,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,Yes?
15448,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,It’s my office.
15449,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,Sheldon.
15450,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,"All right, all right. He can buy his own desk."
15451,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,And I can put it in your office?
15452,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,"Well, you really want to dot the I’s and cross the T’s, don’t you?"
15453,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?
15454,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,They do some of their best work at night.
15455,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Ah, it’s okay."
15456,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Penny? Penny? Penny?
15457,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?
15458,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.
15459,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?
15460,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Oh, absolutely."
15461,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,She does?
15462,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked, why is Howard hiding under the table?"
15463,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"She saw that, huh?"
15464,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out."
15465,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Let me ask you something else. Is she seeing anybody?
15466,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Uh, not that I know of. Hey, while we’re on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?"
15467,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Oh, I’d rather not say."
15468,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Howard, if you want my help, I’ve got to know what happened."
15469,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,But it’s embarrassing.
15470,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Yeah, that’s what I’m counting on. Spill."
15471,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?"
15472,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Um, the online game? Sure."
15473,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?"
15474,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Oh, God. I think I see where this is going."
15475,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Her name was Glissinda the Troll. Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.
15476,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Oh, you’re right. That is so embarrassing."
15477,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Would you talk to her?
15478,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,Bernadette or the troll?
15479,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Bernadette. She was so mad at me, she wouldn’t even listen to my side of the story."
15480,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Well, what was your side?"
15481,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn’t even a real woman. I mean, she could’ve been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey."
15482,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,Really? And that didn’t make her feel better?
15483,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Will you talk to her, see if there’s any chance at all we could get back together?"
15484,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Oh, gee, Howard, I really don’t want to get in the middle of this."
15485,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"No. Why would you? I’m just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11."
15486,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Okay, I will think about it."
15487,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"You know, I’ve always blamed myself for him leaving. I always thought it was because I wasn’t the son he wanted."
15488,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Yeah, I said I’d think about it."
15489,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"I wasn’t athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly."
15490,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Okay, fine. Look, look, I’m calling her now! See?"
15491,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Thank you.
15492,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,"So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee."
15493,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,One question.
15494,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,Yeah?
15495,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Why on earth are you telling me all this?
15496,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,"I don’t know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget you’re not a real boy."
15497,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,You said I could buy a desk.
15498,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,This isn’t a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.
15499,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,"Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?"
15500,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,It’s actually British.
15501,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,Can you say it again for me?
15502,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Brobdingnagian.
15503,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,One more time?
15504,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Brobdingnagian.
15505,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,Now three times fast?
15506,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,"Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna… How did you even get it in here?"
15507,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,"That’s for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out."
15508,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,"All right, you’ve made your point. A fine prank, very amusing. Now get it out."
15509,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,No.
15510,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Yes.
15511,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,No.
15512,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Yes.
15513,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,No.
15514,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Yes.
15515,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,"I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon, I can do this all day."
15516,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,"All right, if you’re not going to remove it, I’ll remove it for you."
15517,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,Knock yourself out.
15518,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Help me move my desk.
15519,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,No.
15520,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Yes.
15521,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,No.
15522,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Yes.
15523,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,No. It’s too Brobdingnagian.
15524,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.
15525,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,"Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I’d say it’s spot-on."
15526,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,"All right, I see what’s going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted."
15527,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,Thank you.
15528,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Stand by for my upcoming tat.
15529,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,"Hey, Sheldon?"
15530,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Yes?
15531,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,No. See what I did there? I turned it around.
15532,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,"Sorry, I had to clock out."
15533,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Oh, no, that’s okay. How have you been?"
15534,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,"Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?"
15535,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Same. I took a scuba-diving course over the summer, but it turns out I’m terrified of the ocean."
15536,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,Too bad.
15537,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"You wouldn’t know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boy’s large? Yeah, forget it. Not important. So, are you seeing anyone?"
15538,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,"Well, to be honest, I…"
15539,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Hey, how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?"
15540,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Not for me, thanks."
15541,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,I’m okay.
15542,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,Are you gonna want to order food?
15543,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Maybe later.
15544,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,Okay.
15545,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"So, are you seeing anybody?"
15546,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,No.
15547,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,That’s what I told him when he asked me. I hope that’s not out of line.
15548,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,"No, it’s fine."
15549,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Penny, can we have a little privacy?"
15550,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,Oh. I’m sorry.
15551,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,"What about you, have you been seeing anybody?"
15552,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Well, you know how it is with guys. I mean, we have needs and…"
15553,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,So you’ve been seeing other girls?
15554,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Well, not real girls."
15555,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,Does that mean slutty trolls?
15556,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"You know, you look thirsty. I brought you some iced tea."
15557,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,Thank you.
15558,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"It’s passion fruit, new on the menu."
15559,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,I know. I work here.
15560,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Oh, sorry. Yeah, you’re right. Doy. So, Howard, trolls, yay or nay?"
15561,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Isn’t there somewhere else you can be?
15562,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,Not where I can hear you guys.
15563,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Okay, fine. I’ll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. But the only reason I go there, the only reason I’ve ever gone there is because I don’t have a real woman in my life. You happy?"
15564,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Yeah, that’ll hold me for a while."
15565,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,"Howard, you did have a real woman. I was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll’s brains out."
15566,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Yeah, but we weren’t, I-I mean, you and I never…"
15567,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,Had sex?
15568,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Yeah.
15569,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,"Well, whose fault was that?"
15570,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.
15571,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"What do you mean, whose fault was that?"
15572,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,"Well, we could’ve been having sex, but you never made the move."
15573,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,I didn’t think you wanted me to make the move.
15574,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,"Howard, a girl doesn’t go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if she’s not expecting him to eventually make the move."
15575,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Really?
15576,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,Really.
15577,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Son of a bitch.
15578,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Penny,"Hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says I can’t actually give nachos away. So, just take that when you’re ready."
15579,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Yeah, we had a really great talk, and we’re gonna start seeing each other again."
15580,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,"Oh, congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?"
15581,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Did Penny tell you about that?
15582,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,No. Steve Patterson told me.
15583,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?
15584,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,Yeah.
15585,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,How’d he know about it?
15586,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,He’s Glissinda the troll.
15587,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,"Sorry, dude, the thermostat’s on my side of the room, so it stays Mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid Indian music!"
15588,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,I’ll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!
15589,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,"Oh, too bad! Sheldon’s pathologically afraid of birds! Hey, look, Sheldon! Birdie, birdie, birdie!"
15590,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,That’s it! Prepare for marshmallow death!
15591,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,Eat flaming Nerf!
15592,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,"So anyway, that’s great news about you and Bernadette."
15593,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,Yeah. I think I’m gonna take her to miniature golf.
15594,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,"Ah. Well, I guess for you guys that’s like regular golf."
15595,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"Short jokes? Really? You’re, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me."
15596,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,"Yeah, and don’t you forget it."
15597,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,I had a good time.
15598,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,"Me, too."
15599,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Katee Sackhoff,"Kiss her good night. All right, now a little tongue."
15600,4,4,the hot troll deviation,George Takei,Hold on there. We’ve only just rekindled the romance. Let’s not sully the moment with the exchange of saliva.
15601,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Katee Sackhoff,Don’t listen to him. She wants it. Tongue. Luh-luh-luh-luh-luh. See? Now make the move.
15602,4,4,the hot troll deviation,George Takei,Mm-mmm. Too soon.
15603,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Katee Sackhoff,"Trust me, she’s ready. Make the move."
15604,4,4,the hot troll deviation,George Takei,"No, no, no. A lady wants to be wooed, courted slowly."
15605,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Katee Sackhoff,How would you know?
15606,4,4,the hot troll deviation,George Takei,I read.
15607,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Katee Sackhoff,"Listen to me, Howard, it’s time. Make the move, now."
15608,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,Mm! What are you doing?
15609,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"You said, well, the move, remember?"
15610,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,"Oh, not now. We’re starting a new relationship. I need to get to know you again."
15611,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Howard,"No, you don’t. It’s me. The lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants."
15612,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Bernadette,"Be patient, we’ll get there."
15613,4,4,the hot troll deviation,George Takei,Told you.
15614,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,"Oh, God, what’s that smell?"
15615,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,Oh-ho-hoo!
15616,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Yes?
15617,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,What are you doing in there?
15618,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,I’m making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. Just a little experiment in pest control.
15619,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,"It’s not gonna work, dude, I grew up in India, an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street, and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement."
15620,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,"Well, we’ll just see how long you can hold out."
15621,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,"Well, we’ll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles."
15622,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,Didn’t you say you’re making hydrogen sulphide gas?
15623,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,Yes.
15624,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Leonard,Isn’t that flammable?
15625,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Sheldon,"Highly. Oh, dear."
15626,4,4,the hot troll deviation,Raj,This is not over.
15627,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"All I’m saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk."
15628,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She’ll appreciate the witticism.
15629,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Thank you.
15630,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,It’ll also help improve her initial impression of you.
15631,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,So what’s going on with you two?
15632,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Well, the status is as it always was. She’s a girl. She’s a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend."
15633,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Right, right. So you’re still just texting and emailing? You don’t feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?"
15634,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Leonard, you are my best friend. I’ve known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler."
15635,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Got it.
15636,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,I sense judgment on your part.
15637,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"No, no. Maybe a little."
15638,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.
15639,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?
15640,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.
15641,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Oh, right. That."
15642,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one."
15643,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,I’m not jealous.
15644,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.
15645,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"You know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there’s probably a Sheldon who doesn’t believe parallel universes exist."
15646,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Probably. What’s your point?
15647,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"No point. It’s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?"
15648,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Hmm, recently? Not much."
15649,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?"
15650,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Um, shut up."
15651,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It’s very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal."
15652,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,That sounds lovely.
15653,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?"
15654,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m just not dating someone right now. I don’t need to go to a senior centre."
15655,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it."
15656,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Fine. If I don’t meet someone soon, you can put me in a home."
15657,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,It’s not a home. It’s a senior centre.  We’d never put Meemaw in a home!
15658,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Hey, guys."
15659,4,5,the desperation emanation,Howard,Hey.
15660,4,5,the desperation emanation,Raj,Hey.
15661,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"All right, I’ll bow to social pressure. Hey!"
15662,4,5,the desperation emanation,Howard,"Excuse me. That’s my girlfriend, Bernadette. I assigned her her own ringtone, Bernadette by The Four Tops. Hello, Bernadette."
15663,4,5,the desperation emanation,Raj,"When I call him, his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which, now that I think about it, is not so good."
15664,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"You realize he’s just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don’t."
15665,4,5,the desperation emanation,Rai,"You mean, you don’t."
15666,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can’t even speak to women.
15667,4,5,the desperation emanation,Raj,"Two words, deaf chick. It doesn’t matter if I can’t talk, because she can’t hear me."
15668,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,What?
15669,4,5,the desperation emanation,Raj,That’s what she said.
15670,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard’s got a girlfriend, Sheldon’s got a girl…"
15671,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"No, no, no, no!"
15672,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,…who’s a friend.
15673,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Thank you.
15674,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?"
15675,4,5,the desperation emanation,Stuart,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I met her at Comic-Con, the one place in the world where saying I own a comic bookstore is an actual pickup line."
15676,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Oh. Well, good for you."
15677,4,5,the desperation emanation,Stuart,"Not really. She’s horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?"
15678,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Why don’t you just break up with her?
15679,4,5,the desperation emanation,Stuart,"No, no, I can’t."
15680,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Why not?
15681,4,5,the desperation emanation,Stuart,"‘Cause then I’d be alone, like you."
15682,4,5,the desperation emanation,Raj,"Dude, why don’t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?"
15683,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Because I don’t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I’m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.
15684,4,5,the desperation emanation,Raj,"Oh, Leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women’s correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free."
15685,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,You’re saying I couldn’t get laid in a women’s prison with a handful of pardons.
15686,4,5,the desperation emanation,Raj,Are you going to let me tell the story or not?
15687,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Leonard? Are you sleeping?
15688,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,No.
15689,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Are you ill?
15690,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,No.
15691,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Are you still depressed because you’re alone, and no one loves you?"
15692,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,I don’t know. Maybe.
15693,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,I want you to know that I’m genuinely concerned about your well-being.
15694,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Thank you.
15695,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,You’re welcome. But it’s still no reason to have your feet in my spot.
15696,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,May I offer an observation?
15697,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,What the hell? How long has she been here?
15698,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Since we got home from the comic bookstore.
15699,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,That was two hours ago.
15700,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"As per your suggestion, we’re hanging out. Quite frankly, I don’t see what all the hoopla’s about. Go on, Amy."
15701,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,"From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation."
15702,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Did you know that, Leonard?"
15703,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,No.
15704,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,I did.
15705,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,I understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns. Have you tried a bar or tavern?
15706,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"No, I’m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar."
15707,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one’s liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?"
15708,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Right.
15709,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,"That’s not true of all bars. Juice bars, for example."
15710,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your premise, Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar, what are you doing?"
15711,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Keep going. I’m listening.
15712,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,That was rude.
15713,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,He does it all the time. He’s a cornucopia of social awkwardness.
15714,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.
15715,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Let’s make that our word of the day.
15716,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,Agreed. And we’ll use mellifluous tomorrow.
15717,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Well, I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you."
15718,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,Wait. I have a request.
15719,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Yes?
15720,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,I’d like you to meet my mother.
15721,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,I see. Can I get back to you on that?
15722,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,Certainly. Good night.
15723,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Good night.
15724,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard."
15725,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Yeah, what?"
15726,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.
15727,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Yeah. So?
15728,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,What does that mean?
15729,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Well, you know how you’re always saying that Amy is a girl who’s your friend, and not your girlfriend?"
15730,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Uh-huh.
15731,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,You can’t say that anymore.
15732,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Wait. What?
15733,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level."
15734,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,I don’t want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!
15735,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?"
15736,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someone’s girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing."
15737,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,That is insane.
15738,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,You’re right. It would never work. Amy finds you tedious.
15739,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Okay, good luck."
15740,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Wait! What am I supposed to do?
15741,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?"
15742,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m a physicist, not a hippie."
15743,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?"
15744,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Screwed.
15745,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,There you go.
15746,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Amy’s right. He is tedious.
15747,4,5,the desperation emanation,Mrs Wolowitz,"Howard, get the door!"
15748,4,5,the desperation emanation,Howard,Why can’t you get it?
15749,4,5,the desperation emanation,Mrs Wolowitz,You know I’m doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy! I’m like an upside-down volcano here.
15750,4,5,the desperation emanation,Howard,"Oh, hey. I hope you didn’t hear that."
15751,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,The volcano thing? No.
15752,4,5,the desperation emanation,Howard,What’s with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store now?
15753,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"No, it’s just something I threw on."
15754,4,5,the desperation emanation,Howard,"I know all your shirts. That’s not one of them. You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women, weren’t you?"
15755,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don’t guard the shirts."
15756,4,5,the desperation emanation,Howard,"So, how’d it go?"
15757,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall."
15758,4,5,the desperation emanation,Howard,"Just FYI, don’t try to go back with a fake moustache. I mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that."
15759,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard."
15760,4,5,the desperation emanation,Howard,You that desperate?
15761,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life."
15762,4,5,the desperation emanation,Mrs Wolowitz,"Holy Moses, how much liquid can be in one tukus?"
15763,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother."
15764,4,5,the desperation emanation,Howard,"Yeah, I know what you mean."
15765,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Well, I’m off to meet Bernadette’s friend. How do I look?"
15766,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel."
15767,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,What are you working on?
15768,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,I’m removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can’t find me and compel me to meet her mother.
15769,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Ah, you’re going off the grid."
15770,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Exactly.
15771,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.
15772,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Thank you. I’ve also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.
15773,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,What if she just comes over?
15774,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,She’ll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.
15775,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,You changed the address on the building? What about mail?
15776,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy."
15777,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Who is it?
15778,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,Amy Farrah Fowler.
15779,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Darn! She found me!
15780,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,She’s been here before.
15781,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get my back, Jack."
15782,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,What do you want to do?
15783,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Tell her I’m not here.
15784,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Okay, where are you?"
15785,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"I don’t know. You’ll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details."
15786,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Hi, Amy. Sheldon’s not here."
15787,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,All right.
15788,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Way to go on the details.
15789,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette."
15790,4,5,the desperation emanation,Bernadette,"Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold."
15791,4,5,the desperation emanation,Howard,Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?
15792,4,5,the desperation emanation,Bernadette,"We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible thing."
15793,4,5,the desperation emanation,Girl,"Hi. Sorry I’m late, I was at the gym. Spin class. Worked up quite a sweat."
15794,4,5,the desperation emanation,Bernadette,"Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy."
15795,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Hi.
15796,4,5,the desperation emanation,Joy,"Hi. You don’t look like a genius. Go ahead, say something smart."
15797,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Uh…
15798,4,5,the desperation emanation,Joy,"Aah! Time’s up. Just kidding. First thing you need to know about me, I’m hilarious."
15799,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?"
15800,4,5,the desperation emanation,Joy,"Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga. Lots of fun. Basically, a hundred different ways to rip a guy’s nuts off."
15801,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Wow. Wouldn’t think there’d be that many.
15802,4,5,the desperation emanation,Joy,Number 42!
15803,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Whoa!
15804,4,5,the desperation emanation,Bernadette,Isn’t she a pip?
15805,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Proxima Centauri’s the nearest star. The celestial bodies that follow are Alpha Centauri A, Toli, Barnard’s Star, Wolf 359, Lalande 21185, Sirius A, Sirius B, BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti, Ross 154, Ross 248, Epsilon Eridani, Lac-9352, Ross 128, Procyon A, oh, darn, that’s wrong!"
15806,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"EZ Aquarii A, EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, Procyon A. Those are the stars that are nearest to me. Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee."
15807,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Oh, dear. They really do be crazy."
15808,4,5,the desperation emanation,Joy,This lobster’s good on the way down and the way up.
15809,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Should be, it’s thirty dollars a pound."
15810,4,5,the desperation emanation,Joy,"Hey, this is a date, right?"
15811,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Yep, it is."
15812,4,5,the desperation emanation,Joy,73!
15813,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,Whoa!
15814,4,5,the desperation emanation,Joy,"Excuse me, I have to go to the little girls’ room and take a wicked whiz."
15815,4,5,the desperation emanation,Bernadette,I’ll go with you.
15816,4,5,the desperation emanation,Joy,"Fair warning, I had the asparagus. My pee is gonna stink up the place."
15817,4,5,the desperation emanation,Howard,I think she likes you.
15818,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, excuse me, madam."
15819,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,Sheldon?
15820,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Rats!
15821,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother.
15822,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"No misunderstanding. I’ve learned what that request actually means, and I don’t want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis."
15823,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,In what way are you screwed? All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she’ll be satisfied that I’m in a relationship.
15824,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,So we’d be perpetrating a ruse?
15825,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,Precisely.
15826,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,And you haven’t fallen hopelessly in love with me?
15827,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,Don’t be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.
15828,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Amy Farrah Fowler, that’s the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me."
15829,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.
15830,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?
15831,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,"Sheldon, please, you’re suffocating me."
15832,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"My apologies. Good night, Amy."
15833,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,"Good night, Sheldon."
15834,4,5,the desperation emanation,Howard,"Come on, just give her a chance. Maybe she’ll grow on you."
15835,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Or maybe she’ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn’t tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life."
15836,4,5,the desperation emanation,Howard,"Seriously? I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I met on J-Date, and that didn’t even crack my top ten."
15837,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect."
15838,4,5,the desperation emanation,Howard,Not that I’ve ever seen.
15839,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,It’s relatively new. I just know that I’m not gonna spend time with someone I don’t like simply to have a girlfriend. I’m okay on my own.
15840,4,5,the desperation emanation,Joy,"Good news, I made lots of room for dessert."
15841,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,"Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but…"
15842,4,5,the desperation emanation,Joy,"Yeah, you, too. Hey, you got anything for next weekend? I need a date for my cousin’s wedding."
15843,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,You’re asking me out?
15844,4,5,the desperation emanation,Joy,"Yeah. And it’s an open bar, so I’ll probably be giving it away."
15845,4,5,the desperation emanation,Leonard,I look forward to it.
15846,4,5,the desperation emanation,Mrs Fowler,"It’s nice to meet you, too, Sheldon. I honestly didn’t believe Amy when she told me she had a boyfriend."
15847,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,I assure you I am quite real and I’m having regular intercourse with your daughter.
15848,4,5,the desperation emanation,Mrs Fowler,What?
15849,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. We’re like wild animals in heat. It’s a wonder neither of us has been hurt."
15850,4,5,the desperation emanation,Mrs Fowler,"Amy, what is he saying?"
15851,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,"You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins."
15852,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, it’s time for me to make love to your daughter’s vagina."
15853,4,5,the desperation emanation,Mrs Fowler,Oh!
15854,4,5,the desperation emanation,Amy,"Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well."
15855,4,5,the desperation emanation,Sheldon,"Agreed. Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out."
15856,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,Gagh!
15857,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Problem?
15858,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,This is the worst cobbler I’ve ever eaten. I mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.
15859,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.
15860,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,"Hey guys, guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya."
15861,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don’t give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya."
15862,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,"Oh, Sheldon. You haven’t changed a bit, have you?"
15863,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Why would I change?
15864,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"The hope has been that you’d eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?"
15865,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,I have a one day layover on my way to Toronto. Corporate merger.
15866,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,Can you believe it? Little Priya’s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.
15867,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it’s actually extremely plausible."
15868,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,And your poll numbers just keep dropping.
15869,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,"I want to catch up with all of you, but first I really must visit the loo."
15870,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"I’m going too, I’ll show you where it is."
15871,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,"Alright, this goes without saying, but I’m just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister."
15872,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Why would I touch her, she’s covered with airplane germs."
15873,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,I’m so not talking to you. I’m talking to him.
15874,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,"Hey, I’ve got a girlfriend now."
15875,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,Oh please. My sister’s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.
15876,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,Let’s just agree they’re both hot.
15877,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,"Dude, that’s my sister you’re talking about."
15878,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,"Okay, forget who’s hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her."
15879,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,Did you pinky swear?
15880,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,Yes.
15881,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,Okay then.
15882,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Cobbler. I’m still laughing.
15883,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,It’s really nice to see you again Leonard.
15884,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Yeah. It’s good to see you too. Here you go.
15885,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,Thanks.
15886,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
15887,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Okay.
15888,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,"So, you got any special plans with your sister?"
15889,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,"Oh, not really, just hang out."
15890,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day."
15891,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,Train day?
15892,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"The fun starts with brunch at Carney’s in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we’re off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, that’s right, the Hollywood Carney’s, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car."
15893,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,I don’t think we’re going to do that.
15894,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Well then apparently, you hate fun."
15895,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Hmm, Priya’s not back yet? Well, I guess that’s not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?"
15896,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,"Uh, my plans with Priya."
15897,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,He rejected train day.
15898,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Did you make it clear that it’s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?
15899,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Abundantly.
15900,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,I guess he just hates fun.
15901,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,That’s what I said.
15902,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,"Okay, so, what’s new with you guys."
15903,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,I have a girlfriend now.
15904,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,"Hey, good for you."
15905,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,"Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. Happy?"
15906,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"So, uh, Priya, what are your plans while you’re here."
15907,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,"I don’t know, I just have the one day."
15908,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Do you like trains?
15909,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,Not particularly.
15910,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.
15911,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It’s locked. Hmm, well, so much for that."
15912,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"It’s getting pretty late, how come you’re still up?"
15913,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,I’ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.
15914,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,That’s pretty cool.
15915,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Oh yes. It runs on the world’s most powerful graphics chip, imagination."
15916,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,You’ve really got to get out more.
15917,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Go north. You can’t go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword."
15918,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"You don’t have the sword. Good golly, it’s as if it’s actually happening to me."
15919,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,Raj finally went to bed.
15920,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Yeah, well,"
15921,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Sheldon’s still up.
15922,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,You said he goes to bed at nine.
15923,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and…"
15924,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my, this is one tough troll."
15925,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,Can’t you get rid of him?
15926,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"If the past is any indication, no."
15927,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down."
15928,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Drop axe.
15929,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Drop axe. Brilliant.
15930,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Give me a minute. Sheldon,"
15931,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon."
15932,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Sheldon, you need to work in the morning."
15933,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,I know.
15934,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Well then, bed mister."
15935,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Five more minutes.
15936,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Really? You’re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.
15937,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.
15938,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"You don’t want that, do you?"
15939,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,No. But it’s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?
15940,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two."
15941,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,That’s unacceptable. We’re supposed to be given written notice.
15942,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"No, no, it doesn’t matter, we’ll be at work."
15943,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there’s no water for an enzyme soak."
15944,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!"
15945,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,I’ll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.
15946,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,We’re going to have to be very quiet.
15947,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let’s see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear, I believe I’m lost. Well, I’ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow."
15948,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I’ll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?"
15949,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Yes.
15950,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"You’re right, you’re lost, good luck."
15951,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,"Oh! Leonard, wake up."
15952,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Huh! Sorry!
15953,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,For what?
15954,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"I don’t know. When I’m in bed with a girl, it’s just, it’s my go to response."
15955,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,"It’s six o’ clock, I have to get back to Raj’s before he wakes up and realises I’m gone."
15956,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer."
15957,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,Mmm. Me too.
15958,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India."
15959,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,"Where are you going with this, Leonard?"
15960,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Well, I’m just saying, I don’t have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out."
15961,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,"Leonard, didn’t we have this conversation five years ago."
15962,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you’re older, I’m older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets."
15963,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,"Sweetheart, just because we have fun when I come to town doesn’t mean I want to have a serious relationship."
15964,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,It doesn’t?
15965,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,"Mm-mm. And besides, I could never bring a white boy home to my parents. They’d have a cow. Which is a much bigger deal in India."
15966,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,I’m not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that’s not the right kind of Indian but it is something.
15967,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,"Aha, you’re funny."
15968,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Leonard, Leonard, Leonard."
15969,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,What?
15970,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,I heard a woman laughing.
15971,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman."
15972,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume."
15973,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Air freshener.
15974,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.
15975,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Uh, rash, that’s a bad rash."
15976,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?
15977,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great."
15978,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Very well, I’m sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch."
15979,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Okay, he’s in the bathroom, let’s go."
15980,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Do you prefer ointment or cream?
15981,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Uh, cream."
15982,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,With or without a numbing agent?
15983,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Without.
15984,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis."
15985,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Fine. With.
15986,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Prescription or non-prescription strength.
15987,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Use your best judgement.
15988,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It’s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts."
15989,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Sounds great.
15990,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Excellent choice.
15991,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Right, right, alright."
15992,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Priya?
15993,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Priya,"Good morning, Sheldon."
15994,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you."
15995,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Making pretty good time, huh?"
15996,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?"
15997,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,No.
15998,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,What do you want to talk about?
15999,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Please don’t tell anyone I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
16000,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,There it is. What if someone asks?
16001,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,No-one’s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
16002,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.
16003,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Like what?
16004,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?"
16005,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Priya and I are both adults. We didn’t betray Raj.
16006,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard."
16007,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,What are you talking about?
16008,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"April 12, 2005, Bob’s Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob’s Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt."
16009,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard."
16010,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,And Raj.
16011,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Alright, and Raj."
16012,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,And me.
16013,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,You?
16014,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause."
16015,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Okay fine, I’m, I’m a horrible human being, I’m the Darth Vader of Pasadena."
16016,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,You’re far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.
16017,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"My point is, Priya’s gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this."
16018,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"You mean, you want me to keep a secret."
16019,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Yes.
16020,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,You know I can’t keep a secret.
16021,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you’d keep that secret. Right?"
16022,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Why do you get to be Batman?
16023,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Because, well, Batman has the secret."
16024,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Well Alfred has secrets too.
16025,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Like what?
16026,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I’ve now just told to Batman. See, I can’t keep a secret."
16027,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Ta-da!
16028,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,What.
16029,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Ta-da. It’s short for da-da-da-da!
16030,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Kind of busy here, Sheldon."
16031,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"I know, that’s why I shortened it."
16032,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,What do you want.
16033,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,I came to go over your alibi for last night.
16034,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,What alibi?
16035,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"You’ve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so I’ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn’t have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman."
16036,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Oh, I’m so sure I’m going to regret this, but, who was I with?"
16037,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary."
16038,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Oh, God."
16039,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"You met her at Pasadena’s most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin’s, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams."
16040,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Leonard, call me if you’re interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary."
16041,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.
16042,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Mechanical voice on Sheldon’s phone,Top of the morning to you. You’ve reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the wee little beep.
16043,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"It’s pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn’t even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie’s flaming auburn hair."
16044,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Where did you get that?
16045,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.
16046,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,An orang-u-tan?
16047,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Well, no-one’s going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything."
16048,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Sheldon, I don’t need an alibi. Nobody’s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip."
16049,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Thank you. Now don’t worry, everything is going to be fine."
16050,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Hey.
16051,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,"Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sister’s never been attracted to him."
16052,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"C’mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she’s attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future."
16053,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya’s preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip."
16054,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,"Hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?"
16055,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,I didn’t see it.
16056,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,Didn’t see it? What were you doing?
16057,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Uh, I was out."
16058,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,On Caprica night?
16059,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink."
16060,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,"Really, you, and where, where did you go?"
16061,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"To, uh, Lucky Baldwin’s."
16062,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Oh, I’ve heard of that place, isn’t that Pasadena’s favourite Irish watering hole."
16063,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Yes.
16064,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?"
16065,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,As a matter of fact I.. I… I can’t… I can’t… I can’t do it.
16066,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Sure you can, you’re doing fine, it’s very believable."
16067,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Look, I’m sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night."
16068,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Don’t listen to him, he’s still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system."
16069,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,What were you doing with Priya?
16070,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?"
16071,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,What? You slept with my sister?
16072,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Yeah.
16073,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,How could you? We had a pact!
16074,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,"Excuse me, I think how could you she’s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!"
16075,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely."
16076,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate."
16077,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,"I… I don’t believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust."
16078,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it."
16079,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,How hard did she stomp?
16080,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Very hard.
16081,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,"Okay, I’m good."
16082,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,"Yeah, well, Raj, I just want to say that I’d never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you."
16083,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Really?
16084,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,Mmm.
16085,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Was it out of respect that you didn’t tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?
16086,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,Dude! I put that thing on my face!
16087,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,I think a more amusing violation of Raj’s trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.
16088,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,"Hey, I didn’t see you giving back your Snoopy snowcone maker."
16089,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,That was all a lie? This year’s gifts are already wrapped!
16090,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,"And as long as we’re talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard’s food."
16091,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy."
16092,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,You put moths in my food?
16093,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,For science.
16094,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,I can’t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.
16095,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Well, uh, I can’t believe you used Sheldon’s toothbrush."
16096,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,You used my toothbrush?
16097,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,"Not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums."
16098,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Okay, I, I, I think it’s safe to say that we’ve all done some things we’re not particularly proud of. But come on, we’re friends. Friends overlook each other’s minor lapses. For the record, Howard, I’m sorry that I broke our pact."
16099,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Howard,"Thankyou, and I’m sorry about your phone. And Thanksgiving. And while we’re at it, you don’t have to wash our clothes on the fourth of July."
16100,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,"As long as we’re apologising, Sheldon, I, I’m sorry I used your toothbrush."
16101,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,And I’m sorry. But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.
16102,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.
16103,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,With real puffing smoke?
16104,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Raj,Yes.
16105,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Alright. But I’m watching you.
16106,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"Hey, you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?"
16107,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Well, sure."
16108,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,"These are pretty god, what flavour is this?"
16109,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,Guess.
16110,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Papaya?
16111,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,No.
16112,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,Guava?
16113,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,You’re so close.
16114,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Leonard,I give up.
16115,4,6,the irish pub formulation,Sheldon,"Mango, caterpillar. What are you doing? You said you liked it!"
16116,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,"No, seriously, I think I’ve finally figured out my problem with women."
16117,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.
16118,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,What does that have to do with me and women?
16119,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.
16120,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,"My problem is, I don’t project confidence. So I decided that the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, I’m going to assume the mantle of self-assurance."
16121,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,"Oh, yeah? What’s that look like?"
16122,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,"Hi. I’m Leonard. And you are beautiful. You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget."
16123,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,Where are we going?
16124,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,Good news. I made it onto the team for the new Defence Department laser-equipped surveillance satellite.
16125,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Excuse me. If we’re changing topics, I believe I have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo."
16126,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,Congratulations Howard.
16127,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,"Thanks. Listen, I have to get a security clearance, so you guys might be hearing from the FBI."
16128,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! I don’t want to speak to the FBI."
16129,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,Why not?
16130,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,I’m brown and I talk funny.
16131,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,They’re just doing a background check on me.
16132,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,"It doesn’t matter. They’ll find a reason to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville. By the way, when I say that, it’s not offensive."
16133,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,"Don’t be ridiculous, Raj. You’re here legally."
16134,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,Nobody cares. Do you know how long it’s been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?
16135,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn."
16136,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,"Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents."
16137,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste."
16138,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,"Oh, Bella, don’t you see? Edward’s only pushing you away because he loves you."
16139,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,Coming.
16140,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Woman at Door,Dr. Koothrappali?
16141,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Woman at Door,"I’m Special Agent Page, FBI. May I come in?"
16142,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Woman at Door,I’d like to talk to you about Howard Wolowitz.
16143,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Woman at Door,"Oh, thank you. All right. Well, how long have you known Mr. Wolowitz?"
16144,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,Rum cake?
16145,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,"No, thanks. Now, about Mr. Wolowitz."
16146,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,Seven years.
16147,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,I see.
16148,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,"I’m in this country legally, you know."
16149,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,"I’m sure you are. Now, to your knowledge, has Mr. Wolowitz ever committed a crime?"
16150,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,"Of course not. I’m here on an H-1B visa, which means I can’t be associated in any way with crime or criminal activity. And I’m not."
16151,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,"Good. To your knowledge, does Mr. Wolowitz have any foreign contacts?"
16152,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,"No, just me. Oh, there it is. Here comes a cavity search."
16153,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,Excuse me?
16154,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,"Please don’t send me back to India, it’s so crowded. It’s like the whole country is one endless Comic-Con, except everybody’s wearing the same costume, Indian Guy."
16155,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,"Dr. Koothrappali, I’m not…"
16156,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,"I love this country! The-the baseball, the freedom, the rampant morbid obesity! From California to the New York Island, I’m a real Yankee Doodle boy!"
16157,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,"Dr. Koothrappali, please."
16158,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,"My country ’tis of thee, duh duh duh liberty, It’s really great."
16159,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,"So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me, I was expecting Mulder. Glad to see I got Scully."
16160,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,Who?
16161,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,"Mulder and Scully. X-Files. The truth is out there. Never mind. Uh, so, what would you like to know?"
16162,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,"You work with Mr. Wolowitz here at the university, correct?"
16163,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,"Yes. Of course, we’re in different departments. He’s an engineer and I’m an experimental physicist. You know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, Hello, maker of the universe, I see what you did there. Good one."
16164,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,"Right. Now, how would you characterize your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz?"
16165,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,"Good. It’s a good relationship. Of course, most of my relationships are good. Probably because I exude confidence. People are drawn to that, you know? Confidence, not exuding."
16166,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,Do you know of any groups Mr. Wolowitz is a member of?
16167,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,"You are beautiful, you know that? You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget."
16168,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,Sounds great.
16169,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,Really?
16170,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,Yeah. Can my six-foot-two Navy SEAL husband come with us?
16171,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,"Is that, oh, my, I didn’t see the ring with my glasses off, so, look at that, I’m starting to exude."
16172,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,Want to get that?
16173,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Not particularly.
16174,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,Could you get that?
16175,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,I suppose I could if I were asked.
16176,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,Would you please get that?
16177,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Of course. Why do you have to make things so complicated?
16178,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,Dr. Cooper?
16179,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Yes.
16180,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,"I’m Special Agent Page, FBI."
16181,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"You say you’re Special Agent Page, FBI."
16182,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,Here’s my I.D.
16183,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,And here is my Justice League membership card. But that doesn’t prove I know Batman.
16184,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,I just want to ask you a few questions about Howard Wolowitz.
16185,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Oh. All right. I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex.
16186,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,Thank you.
16187,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"For the record, I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto?"
16188,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,"Fidelity, bravery, integrity?"
16189,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Correct. Now to business. 18 years ago, I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis. Why haven’t I heard back yet?"
16190,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,"Well, the FBI Crime Lab does have a lot on its plate."
16191,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,That’s of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.
16192,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,Would you mind if we talked about Mr. Wolowitz now?
16193,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"A little, but go on."
16194,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,Thank you. Would you characterize him as responsible?
16195,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"I’m going to answer that with a visual aid. This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.  Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn’t notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?"
16196,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,That’s really not the sort of thing we’re interested in.
16197,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"You heard me say blu-ray, right?"
16198,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,I did.
16199,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Very well. Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?
16200,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,I’m afraid not. Is there anything else?
16201,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Is there anything else? Where would you like to start? He refuses to pay fines when he’s overdue with books I lend him. He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman. He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote, just as good as the first one. If that’s not irresponsible, I don’t know what is."
16202,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,The Mars Rover?
16203,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Did I say Mars Rover?
16204,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,You did.
16205,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"That was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me."
16206,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,"Yes, well, let’s talk about it anyway."
16207,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,I don’t want to. Not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of Howard Wolowitz’s culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars.
16208,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,"Thank you, Dr. Cooper. I think I have all I need."
16209,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Oh, good. I was afraid you were going to fixate on that Mars Rover incident."
16210,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,"Hey, buddies. Guess who didn’t get security clearance to work on the giant space laser?"
16211,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,What happened?
16212,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,"Apparently, the background interviews didn’t go well. You guys wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?"
16213,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,"Well, actually, I may have gotten a little tipsy when I talked to her."
16214,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,And I may have hit on her a little bit.
16215,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.
16216,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,"I see. Well, it’s good to know, when I need you guys, I can always count on you to step up and ruin everything."
16217,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,I feel awful.
16218,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,"Ah, me, too."
16219,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,"To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, it’d be Sheldon."
16220,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Well, your expectations have been subverted. Aha."
16221,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,What are you doing up?
16222,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Sleep eludes me, Leonard."
16223,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,Really? Maybe sleep has met you before.
16224,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Mockery? That’s all you have to offer?
16225,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,I’m sorry. Why can’t you sleep?
16226,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Who knows? I haven’t watched any scary movies recently. I’m no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And it’s been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.
16227,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,Did something happen today that’s bothering you?
16228,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Well, I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance."
16229,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,What?
16230,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,But why should that keep me up?
16231,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,Because you feel guilty?
16232,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Interesting. So you’re saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.
16233,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,"Actually, you don’t have insomnia. You’re sleeping now."
16234,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Excuse me?
16235,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,You’re having a guilt-ridden dream.
16236,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?
16237,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?
16238,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,That seems fairly conclusive.
16239,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"No, Gorn, no. That’s where I sit."
16240,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Thank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page."
16241,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,"Thank you for filing a complaint with my superior, Dr. Cooper. I understand you want to recant your statement about Howard Wolowitz."
16242,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Yes.
16243,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,Was your statement untrue?
16244,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,No.
16245,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,Then I’m afraid you can’t withdraw it.
16246,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I don’t recall you saying no backsies.
16247,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,Is there anything else?
16248,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Yes. I’d like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard’s many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favour. Howard Joel Wolowitz. H is for honesty, of which he has much. O’s for outstanding, which he is such. W’s for witty, he’s quick with a joke. A’s for artistic, his ability…"
16249,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,"I’m sorry, Dr. Cooper, this matter is already closed."
16250,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,But I still have rd Joel Wolowitz left to go.
16251,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,It’s closed.
16252,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"I don’t understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue. For instance, when I first met Leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that."
16253,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Page,This is Leonard Hofstadter?
16254,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"No, it’s a different Leonard. He’s Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye."
16255,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Raj. Have you seen Howard?
16256,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,"I think he’s eating lunch. Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden Planetarium in New York."
16257,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,I’m quite familiar with Dr. Tyson. He’s responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status. I liked Pluto. Ergo I do not like you.
16258,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Dr Tyson,But I actually didn’t demote Pluto. That was a vote of the International Astronomical Union.
16259,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we’d all have a merry Christmas. Think about that, Dr. Tyson."
16260,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Dr Tyson,Is that the guy you were telling me about?
16261,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,"Oh, yeah."
16262,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Howard. The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.
16263,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,You?
16264,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know I went to the FBI and retracted my statement."
16265,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,And they were okay with that?
16266,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"No. If anything, I made it worse. In any case, I have been riddled with guilt, which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep. So, I’m here now to say I’m sorry."
16267,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,"Are you kidding me? You’ve set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with I’m sorry?"
16268,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Yes. I followed the social protocol. I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so I delivered a heartfelt apology. Now you say apology accepted, and I will offer you a one-time-only high five."
16269,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,Your apology is not accepted.
16270,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"You’re tricking me. It really is, isn’t it?"
16271,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,"Leave me alone, Sheldon."
16272,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Dr Tyson,"Dr. Cooper, I just wanted you to know I’m sorry for the role I played in the Pluto matter."
16273,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Oh, shut up."
16274,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,Sheldon?
16275,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Hello.
16276,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,What are you doing here?
16277,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"I have troubles, Penny. I’ve come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep."
16278,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,"You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden."
16279,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,I don’t like the Olive Garden. They treat me like family.
16280,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,"Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?"
16281,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Alcohol.
16282,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,Could you be a little more specific?
16283,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.
16284,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,"I’m sorry, honey, I don’t know millilitres."
16285,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Ah. Blame President James “Jimmy” Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.
16286,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,Would you say that’s about 40 milliliters?
16287,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,More or less.
16288,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,Great.
16289,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,"Now, where were we?"
16290,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there’s an app for that. Let’s see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh. Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so. Rob Roy, Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter. Ooh! I’ll have a Rosewater Ricky."
16291,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,A what?
16292,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"You’ll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. Then ignite the rum, caramel…"
16293,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,"Here you go, one Rosewater Ricky."
16294,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,That’s not how it looks in the picture.
16295,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,"Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. Why don’t you give it a try."
16296,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,All right. To the metric system.
16297,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,I can’t taste the cherries.
16298,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,"All right. Sheldon, what’s on your mind?"
16299,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"I wronged Howard, and he won’t accept my apology."
16300,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,"Oh, right, that. Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey."
16301,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Penny, you face failure on a daily basis. How do you cope?"
16302,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,I drink.
16303,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,To drinking.
16304,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Nope. Oh, if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt."
16305,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,"You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there’s nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn’t talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can’t go back and un-dry-hump someone’s boyfriend."
16306,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"I see. You’re saying I’m facing Starfleet Academy’s unwinnable command scenario, the Kobayashi Maru."
16307,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,Exactly. Sometimes you can’t win.
16308,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Captain Kirk won.
16309,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,Kirk cheated.
16310,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Impressive that you know that. It’s hard to believe I’m actually having this conversation with you.
16311,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,Right there with you.
16312,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator. That’s it.
16313,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,What?
16314,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,I’ll reprogram Howard.
16315,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,"What? Sheldon, you can’t reprogram people."
16316,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"No, you can’t reprogram people. To James Tiberius Kirk."
16317,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Hello, all."
16318,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,Hello.
16319,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,Hey.
16320,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Howard, you’re feeling better about me today, aren’t you?"
16321,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,Not really.
16322,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Yes, you are. I’m using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns."
16323,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,"Oh. Go away, Sheldon."
16324,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,There’s a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.
16325,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,What’s in the bag?
16326,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,It’s for Howard.
16327,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,"Oh. Sheldon, you can’t fix this with gifts."
16328,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,"Nevertheless, I’ve hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this."
16329,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,You’re giving me a couch cushion?
16330,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,No. The cushion is merely symbolic. I’m giving you my spot on the couch.
16331,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,But you love that spot.
16332,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,No. I love my mother. My feelings for my spot are much greater. It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe. And now it’s yours.
16333,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,"Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him."
16334,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,All right. Apology accepted.
16335,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,High five. Not too hard. Thank you.
16336,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Raj,I haven’t cried like this since Toy Story 3.
16337,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Howard,"I got to tell you, Sheldon, I understand why you chose this spot. I mean, the temperature is good, but there’s no draft. I can see the television, but I can still talk to…"
16338,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Sheldon,I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.
16339,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Penny,How long?
16340,4,7,the apology insufficiency,Leonard,94 seconds.
16341,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"Okay, help me out here. How does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?"
16342,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. That’s how I learned.
16343,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,I can’t believe you’ve never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.
16344,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"And I can’t believe you’ve never read Eat, Pray, Love."
16345,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,"When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run Away From A Giant Boulder, I’ll read it."
16346,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,"I don’t care if Eat, Pray, Love changed your life, I’m not reading it."
16347,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"You know, I could totally rock a hat like that."
16348,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"That’s the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman. She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in Michael Jackson’s Thriller video, which I’ve never viewed in its entirety, as I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible. And also, it’s really scary."
16349,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?
16350,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,There’s no switch. Just listen and learn.
16351,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,"Penny, if you think this is good, you should come with us Friday to see it on the big screen at the Colonial."
16352,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"Well, I’m watching it now. Why would I want to see it again on Friday?"
16353,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,Because the print they’re showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.
16354,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"What, 21 seconds? That’ll be like seeing a whole new movie!"
16355,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.
16356,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Did Leonard? I’m no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm."
16357,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Oh, good. I’m eight for 26 this month."
16358,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"Yeah, I think I’ll pass. But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds."
16359,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,"Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we’d still be together."
16360,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn’t."
16361,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,"Uh-huh. I’m guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too."
16362,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"May I point out to you all that the screening is first come, first served?"
16363,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,"Relax, it’s five o’clock. The movie doesn’t start till midnight."
16364,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it’s already five o’clock. Let’s go."
16365,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,"You know, if we miss it, we’ll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives."
16366,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,See? Howard’s on my side.
16367,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,"Actually, I’m not. I’m using sarcasm to mock you."
16368,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,Drat. Now I’m 8 for 27.
16369,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,"Don’t worry, Sheldon. We’ll be fine."
16370,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight premiere of Star Trek Nemesis?
16371,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,"Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn’t wake up to vouch for him, and worst of all, he saw Star Trek Nemesis."
16372,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,But how were our seats?
16373,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,Excellent.
16374,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"I rest my case. Amy, don’t you agree we should leave now and get in line?"
16375,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Actually, as the newest member of your social group, I believe I’ll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time."
16376,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,Shrewd.
16377,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Leonard, you’re right. We should enjoy our meal, arrive late, and risk winding up with terrible seats, assuming we get in at all."
16378,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,"Thank you, Amy."
16379,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,See? It’s working.
16380,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,Knock-knock.
16381,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,Who’s there?
16382,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,Olive.
16383,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,"Olive you, too."
16384,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,"Guys, that’s really starting to get old."
16385,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,Knock-knock.
16386,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,Who’s there?
16387,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,I have a girlfriend and you don’t.
16388,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,Hysterical!
16389,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Wait, now, we don’t know that yet. He isn’t finished. I have a girlfriend and you don’t who?"
16390,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,So. Are you sure you don’t want to come with us to Raiders?
16391,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,"Oh, no. That movie has melting faces. It reminds me too much of the time I dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria into the Rhesus monkey lab. Besides, Penny and I are having a girls’ night tonight."
16392,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,Girls’ night? What does that entail?
16393,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,"Oh, you know, girls get together, hang out, share girl talk."
16394,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,I’m a girl.
16395,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,"Oh. Well, maybe you can join us. I’ll ask Penny."
16396,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,No need. Penny and I are very close.
16397,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,You are?
16398,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Yes. In fact, our menses are synchronized. Penny. Bernadette tells me you’re planning a girls’ night."
16399,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,Yeah?
16400,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,I’m a girl.
16401,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"Oh. Um, it was, it was just going to be me and Bernadette. Besides, I thought you were going to the movies with Sheldon and the guys."
16402,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Yes, but they’re not girls. I’m a girl."
16403,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that."
16404,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,What’s the dress code?
16405,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"Uh, just wear something comfortable."
16406,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,All right. I’ll have to go shopping.
16407,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,Knock-knock.
16408,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,Who‘s there?
16409,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,Hugh.
16410,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,Hugh who?
16411,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,Hugh people need to listen to me. It’s time to get in line for the movie. And that’s how you tell a knock-knock joke.
16412,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Under normal circumstances I’d say, I told you so. But as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already, the phrase has lost all meaning. Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase I informed you thusly."
16413,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,Ooh. Can’t wait for that to start.
16414,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,I informed you thusly.
16415,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Raj,Eight for 28.
16416,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,This is where we could have been if we hadn’t stopped for dinner. This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadn’t ordered dessert.
16417,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Raj,"Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli."
16418,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"And here’s where we are. The runts in a large litter, unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones."
16419,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,So I guess it’s a good thing we stopped for dinner.
16420,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Raj,"You know, guys, when facing disappointment, Eat, Pray, Love teaches us–"
16421,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,"Oh, shut up."
16422,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"So anyway, to make a long story short, turns out I have an unusually firm cervix."
16423,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"You know Amy, when we say girl talk, it doesn’t just have to be about our lady parts."
16424,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,Shame. ‘Cause I have a real zinger about my titled uterus.
16425,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,"Penny, your nails look great."
16426,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"Oh, thanks. I found this place in Alhambra. It’s in a woman’s basement. I think it’s a front for human trafficking, but they do a really good job."
16427,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements. Well don’t tell me that’s not girl talk.
16428,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,So where should we go tonight? A bar? A club? A movie?
16429,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,Or we could just stay here.
16430,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Yes, and continue to bond. I have a feeling that after tonight, one of you will become my best friend forever. Or BFF, if you prefer. Which I don’t."
16431,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two."
16432,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,"Gee, I don’t know if I should drink more. I have to drive home, and I’ve got enough trouble seeing over the dashboard as it is."
16433,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,That’s okay. Y ou can just sleep here.
16434,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Oh, good, a slumber party! We’ll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls, and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties!"
16435,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"Oh, gosh, Amy. I don’t know if I would call this an actual slumber party."
16436,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Well, that’s disappointing. I’ve always wanted to be invited to a slumber party."
16437,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,"Oh, you never were?"
16438,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,Not even when you were a kid?
16439,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Well, there was the time I had my tonsils out, and I shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl. She didn’t make it through the night, but up till then, it was kind of fun."
16440,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"Okay. Well, I guess we’re having a slumber party. Oh!"
16441,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,Pillow fight!
16442,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,"Oh, I hope they let us in soon. I’m tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time. It’s a vicious circle."
16443,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,Too bad you don’t have a stadium pal like me.
16444,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,What’s a stadium pal?
16445,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,"Let me put it this way, takes care of the bathroom problem, and it keeps your calf warm."
16446,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Raj,"Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given the size of the theatre  and the length of this line, we might not get seats."
16447,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,What did he say?
16448,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,"Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap."
16449,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,We might not get seats?
16450,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,"It’s fine, it’s fine. Go back to sleep."
16451,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Oh, I informed you thusly. I so informed you thusly."
16452,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,"Howard, you talk to him. Howard? You’re peeing, aren’t you?"
16453,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Wil Wheaton,"Hey, look who’s here! Hey, buddies!"
16454,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Well, if it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe."
16455,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Wil,Mee-sa think that very funny.
16456,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts."
16457,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Theatre Staff,Wil Wheaton.
16458,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Wil,Yeah.
16459,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Theatre Staff,I’m a big fan.
16460,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,Of what? Poorly executed beards?
16461,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Wil,Do you think you could get me and my friends into the movie? We got here a little late.
16462,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Theatre Staff,"No problem. Come on, I’ll hook you up."
16463,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Wil,"Oh, awesome. We-sa gonna go into the movie now. Bye-bye."
16464,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"This is Indiana Jones, not Star Trek. There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. And even at Star Trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up."
16465,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,"Calm down, Sheldon."
16466,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"I will not calm down. This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered. As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said, the line must be drawn here! This far, no farther!"
16467,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,"Had to wake him up from his nap, didn’t you?"
16468,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,You know what I really love about Howard? His chest hair.
16469,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,Howard has a hairy chest?
16470,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,"No, just the one. But it’s really long."
16471,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"Okay, there you go, Sultry Sunrise Red. What do you think?"
16472,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,My nails have never looked so pretty before. Get it off.
16473,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Raj,"Oh, oh, uh, looks like they’re getting ready to let people in."
16474,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting. Best seats in house for Raiders screening. Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper."
16475,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it’s only going to upset you.
16476,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard. Had Twitter existed at the time, would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull? Would not Lee have followed Grant? Would not Spy have followed Spy? I have more examples, but excuse me."
16477,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Hello. Well, this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality, but go on. Test phrases? All right. Imatote. Ulbu. Twad. All together? I’m a total buttwad. Why are you laughing? Hello?"
16478,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"And that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call."
16479,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"I’m not sure I grasp the full entertainment value, but all right. Next on Wikipedia’s list of slumber party activities, Truth or Dare."
16480,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"Okay, it’s your game. You go first."
16481,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Hang on. I’m familiarizing myself with the rules. Seems fairly straightforward. Bernadette, truth or dare?"
16482,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,Truth.
16483,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,All right. To what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy?
16484,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,Um.
16485,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Remember, you have to answer honestly."
16486,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"Wait. No, Amy, you’re supposed to ask her something personal or embarrassing."
16487,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,Oh. All right. What is the circumference of your areolas?
16488,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Munching on complimentary popcorn. Woot, woot. Oh, the gall. I hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea, choking to death, woot, woot."
16489,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Theatre staff,"Guys, I am sorry. We are full up."
16490,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,No!
16491,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Theatre staff,We’re full up.
16492,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,We really want to see this. Is there anything you can do?
16493,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Theatre staff,Sorry. Fire regulations. Should’ve gotten here earlier.
16494,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don’t.
16495,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Theatre staff,"‘Cause I’m the petty functionary with the clipboard, bitch."
16496,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,I guess that’s that. Let’s go home.
16497,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,You know what? I’m going back to I told you so. I told you so.
16498,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Raj,"We can still see something. Uh, the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away. You know Sandy B always brings it."
16499,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Look, a side door. Come on, Short Round."
16500,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,I guess we’d better go after him.
16501,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,Short Round?
16502,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Raj,Indy’s young sidekick from Temple of Doom.
16503,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,"Yeah, I know who it is, but why is it me?"
16504,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Raj,You’re right. It should be a cuddly Asian boy. Like me.
16505,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"And Absolon hath kist hir nether yea, and Nicholas is scalded in the towte. This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte.”"
16506,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,What the hell was that?
16507,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. The Miller’s Tale by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know. It would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.
16508,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,I thought it was pretty spicy. Especially the part where he kisses her nether yea.
16509,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"You might not like it as much if you knew what nether yea meant. Hint, if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be kissing it."
16510,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,"Okay, my turn. Penny, truth or dare?"
16511,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,Truth.
16512,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,Why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much even though you broke up with him?
16513,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Oh, that’s an excellent question. For two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other’s company."
16514,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,Yeah.
16515,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,Dare.
16516,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,I don’t believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change.
16517,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,Yeah.
16518,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"Okay, look, just because we’re not seeing each other anymore doesn’t mean we can’t be friends. I mean, Leonard’s a great guy."
16519,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?"
16520,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"I don’t know. He got really serious, and I wasn’t ready for it."
16521,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Interesting. How will you react if, in the future, you become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable, because another woman has realized that he is, to use your words, a great guy?"
16522,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,You can only ask one question.
16523,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy and Bernadette together,That one.
16524,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"You know what, I don’t want to play anymore."
16525,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Well, I’m not sure how this is scored, but I believe we may have won."
16526,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,Sheldon? Sheldon?
16527,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,Where did he go?
16528,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,"We’re looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke."
16529,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,You whistled?
16530,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,What is that?
16531,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Raiders of the Lost Ark, with 21 additional seconds. If I can’t see it, no one else can see it."
16532,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,"Sheldon, this is crazy."
16533,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.
16534,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,Listen to me. You are over-tired. You’re not thinking right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble.
16535,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Trouble is my middle name, Leonard. Actually, it’s Lee, but I prefer Trouble."
16536,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Wil Wheaton,"Oh, look who they let in."
16537,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Don’t worry, Wil Wheaton. I was just leaving.  Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!"
16538,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,"Come on, Short Round."
16539,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Leonard,Yeah.
16540,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,"Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!"
16541,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Raj,"Come on, guys! Hurry up! Hurry up!"
16542,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Howard,Let’s see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your leg.
16543,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Wil,He’s got the movie! Get him!
16544,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Sheldon,Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?
16545,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,She’s been in there a long time.
16546,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Clearly, losing Truth or Dare upset her. Perhaps we should try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party activity."
16547,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,"Ooh, like what?"
16548,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,"Well, the Internet suggests that slumber party guests often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism."
16549,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,Where exactly on the Internet have you been looking?
16550,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,Penny?
16551,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Penny,"Oh, hey, Amy. Look, I’m sorry I got so upset. I just,whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa! What are you doing?"
16552,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Amy,Don’t worry. I’ll avoid the nether yea.
16553,4,8,the 21 second excitation,Bernadette,I might have gone with eating raw cookie dough.
16554,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,You know who’s got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe? Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.
16555,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,"You want to talk brave, how about Captain America’s undocumented Mexican gardener?"
16556,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,He’s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?
16557,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,"As usual, you’re all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam."
16558,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?
16559,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,Now you just being silly. Wolverine’s never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer.
16560,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,"Hello. Yes, the elevator’s out of order you’ll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition."
16561,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,I’ll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.
16562,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?
16563,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,That’s a stupid question.
16564,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,We’re having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions.
16565,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Man,Yes?
16566,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Oh, um, is Penny here?"
16567,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Man,"You’re Leonard, right?"
16568,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,Yeah.
16569,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Man,"Damn, it’s good to finally meet you, son."
16570,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Okay, I think a bit of context here might help."
16571,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad."
16572,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Oh, good. Context."
16573,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny’s Dad,"Come on in, buddy. Take a load off."
16574,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Oh, gee, dad, Leonard can’t stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by, sweetie. I’ll see you later."
16575,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,Bye.
16576,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,That was odd.
16577,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,"Are you sure you have enough comics? You’re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you’ve only selected seven hours of reading material. That’s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt."
16578,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,Is that racist? It feels racist.
16579,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,"Don’t be oversensitive. He’s calling you illiterate, not your race."
16580,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,"Oh, okay. Good. I don’t need more comics. Howard’s gonna stop by, we’re gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly."
16581,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,"I don’t care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon."
16582,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,"Actually, Indian Monopoly’s just like regular, except the money’s in Rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist."
16583,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,You’ll never guess what just happened.
16584,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,"You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you’re back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?"
16585,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,No.
16586,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,Aw.
16587,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,Penny kissed me.
16588,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,"Well, who would ever guess that?"
16589,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,What… what kind of a kiss?
16590,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,A big kiss. On the mouth.
16591,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.
16592,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"She introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face."
16593,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,Maybe she was trying to send you a message.
16594,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,You think?
16595,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,Yeah. This man is not my father. I’m being held hostage. So I’m going to do something insane in the hopes that you’ll call 911.
16596,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.
16597,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,"Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that standard, Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs."
16598,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"I’m just saying, it felt like it may have meant something."
16599,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,"Ah, this takes me back. Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I love your new stuff, but once in a while it’s nice to hear the hits."
16600,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,"Ooh, ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh."
16601,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,Why do I bother talking to you people?
16602,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,"If it’ll make you feel better, we rarely listen."
16603,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?"
16604,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
16605,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,I’m starting to think we’re never going to see that pizza.
16606,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,So you’re probably wondering what that was all about.
16607,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"What, uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time."
16608,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of told my father we got back together again."
16609,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,What? Why?
16610,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Well, you’re the first guy he’s ever really approved of, you know? You’re a scientist who went to college and you don’t have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or, or a baby."
16611,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,What kind of guys did you used to go out with?
16612,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Just guys. Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me, how’s Leonard? why can’t you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. So to get him off my back, I told him we worked things out."
16613,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Really? How, how’d we manage that?"
16614,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,What?
16615,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Well, did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?"
16616,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running."
16617,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Yeah, no, I don’t think so."
16618,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Okay, why are you arguing about this?"
16619,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"I’m just saying, if we fake got back together, that’s totally not how it fake happened."
16620,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Oh, okay, whatever. Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?"
16621,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? Cause I’m good with that."
16622,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny’s Dad,"Penny, you out here?"
16623,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Come on, honey, not in front of my dad."
16624,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny’s Dad,"Relax, I’ve seen you do a lot worse with a lot stupider."
16625,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,See? He doesn’t mind.
16626,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny’s Dad,"So, Leonard, I’m taking your gal out for a steak dinner, you want to join us?"
16627,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Oh, dad, that’s nice, but Leonard has to work. Right, Leonard?"
16628,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Uh, I do, I have to work. But I’m gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, ’cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am."
16629,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,Oh.
16630,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Come here, you."
16631,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,C-7.
16632,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,Miss.
16633,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,"How could that be a miss? C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit. Part of your starship has to be on C-7."
16634,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,Not if it has a hole in the middle.
16635,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?
16636,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,A Romulan battle bagel?
16637,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,Knock-knock.
16638,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,"Oh, great, you made it. Come on in. I invited her."
16639,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,So where’s the telescope?
16640,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,"It’s in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here. He’s hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it."
16641,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,"So we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?"
16642,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,I did it with you when we rented The Notebook.
16643,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,"Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure. You’d better open up that bottle of wine or I’m gonna end up with swimmer’s ear."
16644,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,"Excuse me. I can’t be drinking, I’m about to make an important scientific discovery here."
16645,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.
16646,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,How do you know that?
16647,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,"Well, he was Italian. It’s a reasonable assumption."
16648,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,"Dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?"
16649,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,"Oh, I, I’m sorry, Galileo drank diet sprite. Look, you’re my best friend, she’s my girlfriend, you should bond. You know, like you and my mom did."
16650,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,Your mom creeps the hell out of me.
16651,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,"Yes, but she’s stopped calling you slumdog millionaire."
16652,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,I do appreciate that.
16653,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,Here we go.
16654,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,Well I’d like to propose a toast. To science and friendship.
16655,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,"Hold on. Wait. No, it’s okay, go ahead."
16656,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,What?
16657,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,"Oh, I was working with Penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands."
16658,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Thanks for the steak, Wyatt."
16659,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny’s dad (Wyatt),My pleasure. It’s nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny’s that knows how to use a napkin.
16660,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"So not funny, dad."
16661,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with, this, this fella Donnie."
16662,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Oh, will you please let it go?"
16663,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,Donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste into biofuel and selling it to the government.
16664,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,A lot of people are doing that.
16665,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Oh, see?"
16666,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water and pump it into his mom’s Camry."
16667,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Yeah, that’s great. It’s a funny story. Moving on."
16668,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"And Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get beer pong into the Olympics. What was his name, sweetheart?"
16669,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Curtis, and I’m pretty sure he was joking."
16670,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,I don’t know. That petition looked real to me.
16671,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening."
16672,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"Well, I’m just glad you finally found yourself a keeper."
16673,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Thanks, Wyatt. I’m a keeper."
16674,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"Leonard, you want to come in for a nightcap?"
16675,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Oh, gee, dad, he’d love to, but Leonard has to work in the morning."
16676,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,Maybe I could go in a little late.
16677,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"No, no, no, you can’t. Your career is far too important."
16678,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"Behind every great man is a nagging woman who won’t let him have any fun, am I right, Leonard?"
16679,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,Don’t I know it.
16680,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"Well, good night, son."
16681,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Good night, Wyatt. Oh, good night, honey."
16682,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,Good night.
16683,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,I love you.
16684,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Love you, too."
16685,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,"Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again."
16686,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,"Three, four, five, pass go, get 2,000 Rupees, Six, seven, whoops. Can’t go any further. There’s a sacred cow in my way."
16687,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,"Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes."
16688,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,"It won’t help. Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it."
16689,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,Yeah. Like his haircut material.
16690,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,"Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?"
16691,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,No. I got them all cut.
16692,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,Which is still so funny.
16693,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,"And when you go to a Chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie."
16694,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,"Right. Help, I’m a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory."
16695,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,"Okay, I think that’s enough about me."
16696,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,"He’s right. Let’s make fun of his mother. Howard, come rub my feet! My corns are killing me!"
16697,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,"Howard, help me out of the tub! I’m stuck again!"
16698,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Coming. Hey, lovebug."
16699,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,Shut up. You know what I’ve been doing for the last hour?
16700,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Mm, dreamily doodling Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook?"
16701,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,Listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.
16702,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"You got to admit, I am, I’m delightful."
16703,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,Why are you making this so difficult?
16704,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,It’s not difficult for me. I’m having fun.
16705,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,Leonard.
16706,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we’re broken up?
16707,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,No.
16708,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Well, then, what do you want?"
16709,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,I don’t know.
16710,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,Don’t you think that’s something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?
16711,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,Maybe.
16712,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,"Leonard, Penny, excellent. I’d like to say I’m very happy that you’re back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, I’d like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny’s annoying personal habits."
16713,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Oh, my God. What personal habits?"
16714,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12."
16715,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Okay, Sheldon, you don’t have to do this because Leonard and I are not…"
16716,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?
16717,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,Include me in what? Is there a plot afoot? I’ll have no truck with plots.
16718,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"No, you’re right. No, there’s, there’s no plots, no trucks, no feet. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?"
16719,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,"Uh, we don’t discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines."
16720,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,Fines?
16721,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,"Yes. If Penny’s going to be spending nights here again, you’ll need to set up an escrow account. Sign here."
16722,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,"Hello, Hawaii. This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena. I’d like you to reposition the telescope, please. Scarlett Johansson’s house! I’m kidding, Hawaii. Mahalo. Whoo!"
16723,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,It might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.
16724,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,"Well, live and learn. So, Raj, do you think this planet you’re looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?"
16725,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,"Maybe. If it did, I’d be famous. I’d be on the cover of magazines. And then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, I’d have a big mansion."
16726,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,That sounds great.
16727,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,"It is. If you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you."
16728,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,We’d come visit you.
16729,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,"No, you wouldn’t. You’d be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people I hired to be my living chess set."
16730,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,"He’s taking a turn to the dark side, isn’t he?"
16731,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,Hold on. He could come back.
16732,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,"Oh, what’s the point of everything?"
16733,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,Nope. He’s gone.
16734,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,You know it’s been more than a year since I’ve even kissed a girl?
16735,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,What about that hook-up at Comic-Con you told me about?
16736,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,"Oh, grow up. I was lying. I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me."
16737,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,"Oh, you poor, poor thing. Raj, you have to know you’re a wonderful man. There are a lot of girls out there who’ll want to kiss you."
16738,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,Where?
16739,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,You just have to look.
16740,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,No!
16741,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Bernadette,"Well, this was fun."
16742,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,Oh! I think I got a nibble.
16743,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in."
16744,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"Oh, look at that baby. They’re really biting, huh?"
16745,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.
16746,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"Oh, that’s me. Hello. Oh, hi, sweetie. Yeah, I got up early and didn’t want to wake you, so I went out for coffee and ran into Leonard on the way back. Guess what, we’re fishing. Yeah. Right here on his couch."
16747,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Hey, baby. I love you! Mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh."
16748,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"That’s Leonard says he loves you. What? I see. The whole thing’s bull squirt, huh? Well, that’s very disappointing. Bye."
16749,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Oh, hey. There’s been something I’ve been meaning to tell you."
16750,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,I can’t believe you would lie to me like that.
16751,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this."
16752,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,I’ll get to you in a minute.
16753,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,No hurry.
16754,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"That my own daughter thinks I don’t love her enough to support her no matter what choices she makes, well, that hurts me deeply."
16755,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"I’m sorry, daddy…"
16756,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,Let me finish.
16757,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,Oh.
16758,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,I thought we were past the days when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes. Telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri? And the pee stick in your bathroom is to check for diabetes?
16759,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"You know, I’m sorry."
16760,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"You’re a grown woman, and I respect your right to make your own decisions, but all I ask is you respect me enough to be honest about them."
16761,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"You’re right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth."
16762,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"Thank you. Now, why don’t you go and put some clothes on and we’ll grab a bite to eat before I head for the airport. Now you."
16763,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,"Daddy, he had nothing to do…"
16764,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,Keep walking.
16765,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Penny,Okay.
16766,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"Please, please, please don’t give up on her."
16767,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,What?
16768,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"I can’t go back to the skateboard idiots, the white rappers and all those sweaty dumb-asses with their backwards hats."
16769,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Gee, I don’t know if it’s in the cards, sir."
16770,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"Then, stack the deck. Cheat. Lie. I don’t care. I want grandkids before I die, and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels."
16771,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,I’ll give it a shot.
16772,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,Thank you. Now I’m going to do something here to help you along.
16773,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,Excuse me?
16774,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,"Just don’t panic. Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face and make sure I never see it again!"
16775,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That’s very clever."
16776,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Wyatt,Don’t yap. Just get out.
16777,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,I’ll friend you on Facebook.
16778,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,"Oh, there you are. Just so you know, I was up all night, but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement."
16779,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again."
16780,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,"Do you even think about other people, Leonard? Do you?"
16781,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,Hey.
16782,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,"Oh, how’d it go last night?"
16783,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,"Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop."
16784,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?
16785,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,Why? You writing a book?
16786,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,"I’m going to propose a hypothesis. Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret."
16787,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?
16788,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.
16789,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,Hey.
16790,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,Hey.
16791,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Sheldon,Hello.
16792,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,Hey.
16793,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,Hey.
16794,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Leonard,You get to play with Raj’s big telescope last night?
16795,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,Whoa. Where did that come from?
16796,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,He never touched my telescope.
16797,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,Way to go shutting up.
16798,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,I did shut up. Now you shut up.
16799,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Howard,Fine.
16800,4,9,the boyfriend complexity,Raj,Thank you. How come you didn’t call me this morning?
16801,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Clarify something for me. Isn’t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?
16802,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Leonard,"It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death."
16803,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation."
16804,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Leonard,Great.
16805,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"What is the best number? By the way, there’s only one correct answer."
16806,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?"
16807,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Wrong. The best number is 73. You’re probably wondering why.
16808,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Leonard,No.
16809,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,Uh-uh.
16810,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,We’re good.
16811,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?"
16812,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Leonard,We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.
16813,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"Chuck Norris wishes. In binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc."
16814,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"Just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies."
16815,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Leonard,Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn’t want to eat with us tonight?
16816,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"Yeah, I get it now."
16817,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,"I love your little heart locket, Bernadette."
16818,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Bernadette,"Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me. It’s the cutest thing. Every time I have dinner with his mom, the next day I get jewellery."
16819,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"Did you know that the iconic Valentine’s heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?"
16820,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,"Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I’s with little asses? Cool."
16821,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Zack,"Hey, Penny, how’s it going?"
16822,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,"Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?"
16823,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Zack,My dad’s company prints the menus for this place. I’m just dropping off some new ones laminated. Makes ’em easier to clean if people throw up on ’em. Guess how I got the idea?
16824,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah, I got it, I got it. Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy."
16825,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Bernadette,Hi.
16826,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Zack,Hey.
16827,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,Hoo.
16828,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Zack,"Okay, well, it was good to see you."
16829,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah, you, too."
16830,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Bernadette,He’s really cute. How do you know him?
16831,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,"Oh, we went out a couple of times."
16832,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,I’m often flummoxed by current slang. Does went out mean had intercourse?
16833,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Bernadette,Yes.
16834,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,"No, no. But in this case, yes."
16835,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?
16836,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,"No, it was great. He just didn’t really challenge me on an intellectual level."
16837,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Bernadette,Couldn’t you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?
16838,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,Wouldn’t help. Zack can’t even spell NPR.
16839,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Bernadette,It’s what I do with Howard. I’m much smarter than he is. But it’s important to protect his manhood.
16840,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,Hoo.
16841,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Bernadette,What’s the matter?
16842,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"I’m suddenly feeling flushed. My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. In addition, I keep involuntarily saying hoo."
16843,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,"Oh, we know what’s causing that, don’t we?"
16844,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,It’s no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Tourette’s syndrome.
16845,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?
16846,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Leonard,No. What happened?
16847,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.
16848,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,Did he get superpowers?
16849,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot."
16850,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"Oh. Well, that’s disappointing."
16851,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,Why?
16852,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero."
16853,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"Yeah, but who’d want to become Rat-Man?"
16854,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"Who wouldn’t? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man, you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy."
16855,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,Mouse Boy?
16856,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"You don’t like Mouse Boy? How about, uh, uh, Kid Vermin?"
16857,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldn’t be the sidekick. You’d be the sidekick."
16858,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,Rat-Man is nobody’s sidekick.
16859,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, who’s the obvious sidekick?"
16860,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"Yeah, Leonard, who?"
16861,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Leonard,"12 years after high school, and I’m still at the nerd table."
16862,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Aren’t you slicing that man’s brain a little too thin?
16863,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"It’s too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it’s fine."
16864,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"Well, you’re the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield."
16865,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon."
16866,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Thank you.
16867,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to take my temperature."
16868,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth."
16869,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so I’m checking my vital signs every hour."
16870,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,I’d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.
16871,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"Oh, that sounds like fun."
16872,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,All right. What were the symptoms?
16873,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing."
16874,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Localized to what region?
16875,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,Ears and genitalia.
16876,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.
16877,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny’s friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said hoo."
16878,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Who?
16879,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,Zack.
16880,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Then why did you ask?
16881,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,Ask what?
16882,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Who.
16883,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,Zack.
16884,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"All right, let’s start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?"
16885,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,Hoo.
16886,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Zack.
16887,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,Why do you keep saying Zack?
16888,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Because you keep saying who.
16889,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,I’m not saying hoo now. I said hoo last night.
16890,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"And the answer was Zack, correct?"
16891,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,There was no question. I simply said hoo.
16892,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal."
16893,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?
16894,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,There you are.
16895,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"Oh, hey."
16896,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?
16897,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"I don’t know. Um, nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you’re going to die, and then you do."
16898,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"No. Something very specific that we both know you, Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of."
16899,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"Well, type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe…"
16900,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,Spiders! You’re afraid of spiders!
16901,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,What the heck is this?
16902,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"A jar with a big spider in it, of course. Bravery test. First one to take his hand out is the sidekick."
16903,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,Are you crazy?
16904,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,Perhaps. Are you scared?
16905,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,No. But it’s a stupid test.
16906,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"Oh, really? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?"
16907,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"Oh, yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?"
16908,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"Oh, come on. That’s never gonna happen. Now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick."
16909,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"All right, I will."
16910,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,How did you get so brave all of a sudden?
16911,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,It’s easy. The spider’s crawling up your arm.
16912,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"Get it off! Get it off! Please, Raj! Ah! Ah! Ah! Please. Oh!"
16913,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,My blood work shows thyroid function normal. Cortisol levels normal.
16914,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?
16915,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"Sheldon, I am not going through menopause."
16916,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.
16917,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Penny’s friend Zack."
16918,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Hang on. I don’t know that we’ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.
16919,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"Let’s look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal."
16920,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself."
16921,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,Religion?
16922,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Star Trek. Did you see Star Trek The Motion Picture?
16923,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,No.
16924,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"Don’t. It’s terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar."
16925,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?
16926,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Cheap science fiction?
16927,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,What are you doing?
16928,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.
16929,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?
16930,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"I hadn’t considered that. Give me a moment. All right, I’ve considered it."
16931,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,And?
16932,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,I reject it.
16933,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"You reject it because you don’t feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?"
16934,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,I think I’ll eat my lunch at home.
16935,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"That’s not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens."
16936,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi."
16937,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Hello.
16938,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,Hey. Isn’t tomorrow your usual laundry night?
16939,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I’ll need time to make things right."
16940,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,That’s thinking ahead.
16941,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,The alternative would be to think backwards. And that’s just remembering.
16942,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,So how’s Amy?
16943,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Amy’s changed. I might have to let her go.
16944,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,"Oh, no. Why?"
16945,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you."
16946,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,Just going to skip over that insult.
16947,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,What insult?
16948,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah. That’s why I’m going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what’s the scientific word?"
16949,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Forget science. She’s horny.
16950,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,Oh! Okay. Wow.
16951,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,It’s simple biology. There’s nothing I can do about it.
16952,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,Are you sure?
16953,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,What are you suggesting?
16954,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,I’m suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy’s urges?
16955,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,It’s illegal to spay a human being.
16956,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,Yeah. That’s not what I had in mind.
16957,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.
16958,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,Exactly.
16959,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. I’ll let you know what happens."
16960,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Penny,"Oh, Amy, you lucky girl."
16961,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. I’m looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling I’m speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes, that does sound like a girl’s name. No, it doesn’t bother me. Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why I’m calling. I’d like to know if you’d be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, that is a girl’s name. Good grief. It’s like trying to talk to a dolphin."
16962,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Leonard,Really? This is going to decide who’s the hero and who’s the sidekick?
16963,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,You got a better idea?
16964,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Leonard,Every idea is better than this idea.
16965,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,Ding!
16966,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,Wait. What the hell is ding?
16967,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,It’s a bell.
16968,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,I don’t think this kind of wrestling has a bell.
16969,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,Fine. How do you want to start?
16970,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?"
16971,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,One-two-three-go? That’s for babies.
16972,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"Okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?"
16973,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"That’s for a footrace. If you want to race, we have to go outside."
16974,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"No, it’s chilly outside. Didn’t bring my jacket."
16975,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"Oh, for crying out loud. What kind of superhero needs a jacket?"
16976,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights."
16977,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle."
16978,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you’re going to say when we do start, or…"
16979,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,We’re starting now!
16980,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,Don’t yell at me!
16981,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Leonard,Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.
16982,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?
16983,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,I’m sure it’ll wash off.
16984,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell’s Angel.
16985,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,There’s Zack.
16986,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Are you sure this is what you want to do?
16987,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"It’s not what I want to do, it’s what I have to do."
16988,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,"Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system."
16989,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"Thank you, Sheldon. You’re a good friend."
16990,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,Please don’t drag this out. This is never going to come off.
16991,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare’s metaphorical beast with two backs."
16992,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Zack,My gluteus what?
16993,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,"On the other hand, as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar. Good-bye, Zack."
16994,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Zack,Bye. Hoo. That should hold me for a while.
16995,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,I’m legally obligated to inform you that I took a karate lesson when I was 11. I’d be a regular ninja by now if my mom could’ve arranged a carpool.
16996,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"Oh, yeah? Well, I’ve been taking Pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar."
16997,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"Oh, yeah? Won’t matter, you’re going down!"
16998,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"No, uh-uh, you’re going down!"
16999,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"If anybody’s going to go down, it’s going to be you."
17000,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Leonard,Fellas. It’s been 30 minutes. Nobody’s touched each other.
17001,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,I’m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.
17002,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,As am I.
17003,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Sheldon,What are you doing?
17004,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Amy,An experiment. Nope. Nothing. Never mind.
17005,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,You realize you can’t win.
17006,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,I prefer to think that I can’t lose.
17007,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,You’re wrong. It’s only a matter of time before you fall into Rat-Man’s rat trap.
17008,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,"You pathetic fool! If there were a rat-catcher, wouldn’t it catch Rat-Man?"
17009,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,Just because I didn’t express myself well doesn’t mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!
17010,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Howard,You narcissistic nincompoop!
17011,4,10,the alien parasite hypothesis,Raj,"You crimson coward! Oh, Leonard, wake up, you’re missing some very excellent superhero quips."
17012,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,Water Demon.
17013,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,Ice Dragon.
17014,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,Lesser Warlord of Ka’a.
17015,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.
17016,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,Infinite Sheldon?
17017,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work."
17018,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,Do you understand why people don’t want to play with you?
17019,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"No, although it’s a question I’ve been pondering since preschool."
17020,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,Hey.
17021,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,Hey.
17022,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,Hey.
17023,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox."
17024,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"Oh, thanks."
17025,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,Mm-hmm.
17026,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Check it out, all about planets this month."
17027,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,That’s an atom.
17028,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Agree to disagree. That’s what I love about science, there’s no one right answer."
17029,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"So, you and Zack again, huh?"
17030,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again."
17031,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,Were we here earlier?
17032,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"Okay, we should, we should go."
17033,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Ah, not yet. I want to talk science with the science dudes."
17034,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,"Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. What do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?"
17035,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel. Turns out that if you kill a starfish, it’ll just come back to life."
17036,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.
17037,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"No, I’m almost sure that it was the Discovery Channel. It was a great show. They also said dolphins might be smarter than people."
17038,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,They might be smarter than some people.
17039,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Well, maybe we can do an experiment to find out."
17040,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"Oh, that’s easy enough. We’d need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty."
17041,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,I don’t get it.
17042,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,A dolphin might.
17043,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Oh, I see. You guys are inferring that I’m stupid."
17044,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,That’s not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.
17045,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,Let’s go.
17046,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you."
17047,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,What the hell did I do?
17048,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,You laughed.
17049,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,You think Penny’s right? Were we bullying Zack?
17050,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,"No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free."
17051,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.
17052,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,That happened to you?
17053,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.
17054,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"I don’t know, I think we might owe the guy an apology."
17055,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,So go apologize.
17056,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,Why me?
17057,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,"You started it, we just piled on."
17058,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,What would I even say?
17059,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"Zack, I’m sorry you’re stupid. Have a Milk Dud."
17060,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,A Milk Dud?
17061,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies."
17062,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"I got a better idea. We’re all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who’s with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?"
17063,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.
17064,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,You’re embarrassing yourself.
17065,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Penny.
17066,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,What?
17067,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack."
17068,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,What do you want?
17069,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around."
17070,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"No, you weren’t. You were making fun of me."
17071,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"Come on, that’s what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis."
17072,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,That’s very hurtful.
17073,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,See?
17074,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"I don’t know, it still wasn’t very nice."
17075,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Milk Dud?
17076,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Oh, I love Milk Duds. Okay, we’re cool."
17077,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Junior Mints.
17078,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,You guys want to come in and have a beer?
17079,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"Uh, we’re on our way to the comic book store."
17080,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,Leonard’s buying.
17081,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,Really? I haven’t been to a comic book store in literally a million years.
17082,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Literally? Literally a million years?
17083,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,Don’t.
17084,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,You want to go with ’em?
17085,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,No.
17086,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Okay, see you later."
17087,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you’re ditching me to go look at comic books?"
17088,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,Are you mad at me?
17089,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,I’m not happy.
17090,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,Milk Dud?
17091,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Wow, this place is awesome. Where do they keep the Archies?"
17092,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong."
17093,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Oh, no, you’re thinking old-school Archie. It’s much more sophisticated now. Like, there’s two universes, and Archie’s married to Betty in one and Veronica in the other. Midge is even breaking up with Moose."
17094,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,No.
17095,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"About time, right?"
17096,4,11,the justice league recombination,Stuart,Hey.
17097,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,Hey.
17098,4,11,the justice league recombination,Stuart,You guys finally chip in for a bodyguard?
17099,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He’s a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store."
17100,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Wow, lucky you."
17101,4,11,the justice league recombination,Stuart,"Yeah, I work 70 hours a week and average a dollar sixty five an hour."
17102,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,Sweet.
17103,4,11,the justice league recombination,Stuart,Is that sarcasm?
17104,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,"Uh, no, it’s an indictment of the American education system."
17105,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,The Archies are over here.
17106,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,Yippee.
17107,4,11,the justice league recombination,Stuart,So are you guys coming to my New Year’s Eve costume party?
17108,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Of course. We’re coming as the Justice League of America.
17109,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.
17110,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly Leonard as Superman."
17111,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches."
17112,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"That’s sad. Let’s ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?"
17113,4,11,the justice league recombination,Stuart,Than than Leonard in high-heeled boots? Howard’s mother in high-heeled boots?
17114,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.
17115,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,Zack?
17116,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,He is the only person we know with actual muscles.
17117,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,You can’t replace me with Zack.
17118,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Why not? Penny did it.
17119,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,"Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn’t we be?"
17120,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Score. I got an Archie, Betty and Veronica, and a Jughead. All set for my weekend number twos."
17121,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?"
17122,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"I don’t know, sounds like a lot of responsibility."
17123,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"Fine, if Zack’s going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern."
17124,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,But I’m Green Lantern.
17125,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,You can be Aquaman.
17126,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,I don’t want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.
17127,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere."
17128,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Hey, babe."
17129,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,I’m still mad at you.
17130,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Well, you won’t be when you hear the great news."
17131,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,What great news?
17132,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"We’re going to a costume party at the comic book store on New Year’s Eve, and you get to be Wonder Woman."
17133,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.
17134,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"Wait, why me? Wh-Why can’t your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?"
17135,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.
17136,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"Okay, what about your friend Amy?"
17137,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Amy Farrah Fowler doesn’t believe in wearing costumes. She isn’t the free spirit I am.
17138,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"Okay, well, forget it. I’m not spending my New Year’s Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume."
17139,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,He says he’ll wear it if you’ll be Aquaman.
17140,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,What are you doing?
17141,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,We’re going to be late. I’m pacing nervously.
17142,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,You’re jogging.
17143,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,This is how the Flash paces.
17144,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"Just chill out, Sheldon."
17145,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,I’m not Sheldon. I’m the Flash. And now I’m going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I’m back.
17146,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,I’m Batman.
17147,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he’s running late."
17148,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,I had to walk. I couldn’t get Raj on the back of my scooter.
17149,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,"I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again. Aquaman sucks."
17150,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,Look up in the sky. It’s a bird. It’s a plane. I forget the rest.
17151,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,All right. Let’s get this thing over with.
17152,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,I’m sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?
17153,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,"Relax. No one’s going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow."
17154,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Hold on. The costume came with a black wig. Where is it, babe?"
17155,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,No. I’m not wearing it. It looks stupid.
17156,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,Come on. We’re trying to win a contest here.
17157,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,Forget it. I’m not wearing the wig.
17158,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Penny, there’s no I in Justice League."
17159,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,"Well, actually."
17160,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Don’t. He’s making our case.
17161,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Okay, babe. Uh, kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends."
17162,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I’m not going.
17163,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.
17164,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Babe, open up."
17165,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,I’m not talking to you.
17166,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,Then who are you talking to? Babe?
17167,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny."
17168,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,What the hell is wrong with you?
17169,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"I’m the Flash. I just knocked 30,000 times."
17170,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?"
17171,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,I understand why you’re upset.
17172,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,Really?
17173,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Yes. You’re afraid that costume makes you look fat.
17174,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"No. Wait, wait, does it?"
17175,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Don’t worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.
17176,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"Good-bye, Sheldon."
17177,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"But they’re not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?"
17178,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,Stupid Aquaman.
17179,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time."
17180,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,Whoa. You dated Penny?
17181,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,She didn’t tell you?
17182,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,She told me she dated a guy named Leonard. Who would have thought it was you?
17183,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,Who else would it be?
17184,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"I don’t know. Somebody bigger and, yeah, sure. Why not you?"
17185,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,I may have failed.
17186,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,"Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman."
17187,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,I don’t want to go without Penny.
17188,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,"Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we’ve got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight."
17189,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"Obviously, we’re no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes."
17190,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,"Ooh, I call Kermit."
17191,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,I’m Kermit. You’re Scooter.
17192,4,11,the justice league recombination,Raj,"Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He’s the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies."
17193,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,"No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny."
17194,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,What makes you think I can convince her?
17195,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,"You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing."
17196,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?"
17197,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.
17198,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"Go away, Sheldon."
17199,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,It’s Leonard.
17200,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"Oh. Go away, Leonard."
17201,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"Come on, let me just talk to you."
17202,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,It’s open.
17203,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,Hey.
17204,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"I’m not going to that party, Leonard."
17205,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"Okay, listen. You don’t have to wear the wig. At this party, we’re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl."
17206,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,It’s not the wig.
17207,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him."
17208,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"Okay, look. We’re not really me and him."
17209,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,Then what are you?
17210,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,I don’t know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn’t be alone on New Year’s Eve. How pathetic is that?
17211,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year’s Eve.
17212,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,You make a cute Green Arrow.
17213,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,Green Lantern.
17214,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,Like there’s a difference.
17215,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,There’s a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.
17216,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,"Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you."
17217,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,What about me?
17218,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,Nothing. Let’s go to the party.
17219,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,How do I look?
17220,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"Um, I guarantee you’ll be the prettiest girl there."
17221,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,"Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman."
17222,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Oh.
17223,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,Yes.
17224,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,What’s the bad news?
17225,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,Superman probably isn’t getting laid tonight.
17226,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,"Aw, damn."
17227,4,11,the justice league recombination,Stuart,And the award for best group costume goes to Justice League of America number three!
17228,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Thank you! Thank you so much!
17229,4,11,the justice league recombination,Stuart,"Okay. Okay, ten seconds to midnight."
17230,4,11,the justice league recombination,All,"Ten, nine, eight…"
17231,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"No, wait! I have a speech."
17232,4,11,the justice league recombination,All,"Seven, six…"
17233,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Stop counting!
17234,4,11,the justice league recombination,All,"Five, four, three…"
17235,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"This is my moment, dag nab it!"
17236,4,11,the justice league recombination,All,"Two, one! Happy New Year!"
17237,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,I’m not going to say another word until you people settle down. I’m waiting.
17238,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,That was a great party. We should dress like this all the time.
17239,4,11,the justice league recombination,Penny,Are you high?
17240,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,You’re being a bully.
17241,4,11,the justice league recombination,Howard,Check it out. Those guys are breaking into that car.
17242,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,What should we do?
17243,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,We’re the Justice League of America. There’s only one thing we can do. Turn around and slowly walk away.
17244,4,11,the justice league recombination,Zack,Nah. Hold up.
17245,4,11,the justice league recombination,Leonard,"Look, I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but I’m a little warm, so I’m going to turn it down."
17246,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,"Good Lord, how you frustrate me, Leonard Hofstadter!"
17247,4,11,the justice league recombination,Sheldon,Fine.
17248,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,"Ma, Ma, calm down. Listen to me. I know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse. Now, put your finger on it. Doesn’t matter which finger. Good choice. Now move it down to your e-mail icon. Yeah, the little envelope. What do you mean, what does it look like? It looks like an envelope! Fine, you don’t like the computer, don’t use it! Sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. Good-bye!"
17249,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,"That’s a Hanukkah present you’re regretting, huh?"
17250,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"I won’t say that all senior citizens who can’t master technology should be publicly flogged, but if we made an example of one or two, it might give the others incentive to try harder."
17251,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"I had a great idea. You know how we’re always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you’re doing Fourier analysis, or using the Schrodinger equation?"
17252,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Howard doesn’t. He’s only an engineer.
17253,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"I was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. You just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!"
17254,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,You know what’s a great app? The one that makes fart noises.
17255,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"You know, Leonard, that’s actually a valid idea. Very good."
17256,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,Can you say that and not make it sound like I’m a cat who learned how to use the toilet?
17257,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"No. The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, I’d have to give a slight edge to the cat. I’ll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations."
17258,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"Oh, yay for me. What about you guys? I can’t promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this."
17259,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,A few extra bucks would be nice. I could finally move out of my mother’s house.
17260,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,Where would you go?
17261,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,I always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage.
17262,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,"You know, if I made more money, I could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides."
17263,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,What’s that? Some weird sex thing?
17264,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,"No. You take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine, and you show them fish. Why does everything have to be dirty with you?"
17265,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"I was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, we’ll have ourselves an app to sell."
17266,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,Sounds like we’re in business.
17267,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.
17268,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,Yeah.
17269,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Oh!
17270,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,"Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent, or what?"
17271,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.
17272,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, shush."
17273,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,What?
17274,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"You have so few good ideas, Leonard. And you’re just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?"
17275,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Who, me?"
17276,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,"Sheldon, I don’t think Penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential…"
17277,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas."
17278,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,She’s not going to steal our idea.
17279,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,What idea?
17280,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,We’re gonna write an application…
17281,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"The prairie sky is wide and high, deep in the heart…"
17282,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Okay, stop, stop!"
17283,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Of Texas.
17284,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Whatever your secret is, I’m sure it’s boring, so I’m not interested."
17285,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"It’s not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that…"
17286,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,Bored.
17287,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,Satisfied?
17288,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.
17289,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Hey, wait a minute."
17290,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,"Well, hang on. Let’s see where he’s going."
17291,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard."
17292,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,"Hey, I…"
17293,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,Hang on. Let’s see where he’s going.
17294,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"She befriends them, and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder."
17295,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,That is ridiculous.
17296,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, is it? Well let’s see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time."
17297,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Oh, great. You know what? I’ve already mooched dinner off you guys. I don’t need to listen to this."
17298,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,"There’s your answer, free food."
17299,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"All right, I’ve taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app."
17300,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,"Hey, why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist."
17301,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we’re a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.
17302,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,Oh. Very clever. But still racist.
17303,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Duly noted, Steve from Wichita."
17304,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,Why am I listed as your executive assistant?
17305,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute. FYI, my mother’s birthday is coming up. I’m going to need you to pick up a present."
17306,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"Okay, we need to stop for a minute."
17307,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Leonard, please, we can talk during our break. We have one coming up at midnight. We’ll need snacks."
17308,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re not in charge. It’s my idea. I’m in charge."
17309,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, of course you are. Look at the organizational chart. You’re clearly listed as founder."
17310,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"Well, yes, and you’re listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer."
17311,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"You missed Chief Science Officer, Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee."
17312,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.
17313,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,Ooh. Leonard’s going all alpha nerd on Sheldon’s ass.
17314,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"All right. All right, I’m not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter, you have the conn."
17315,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.
17316,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, we’re doomed."
17317,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients."
17318,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Good one, boss."
17319,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,What?
17320,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,This diagram. I assume you were opening with a joke. It certainly buoyed up this employee’s esprit de corps.
17321,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,It’s not a joke. It’s the real design.
17322,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?"
17323,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"Sheldon, I think this will work. Let’s just try it my way."
17324,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m, I’m sorry. I assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees, but I realize now, you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men."
17325,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,Are you done?
17326,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"If you say so, boss."
17327,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,"So right now, this button-press event is just triggering a dummy procedure call…"
17328,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,How about this for the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator.
17329,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,So it spells Sheldon?
17330,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Does it? A happy accident.
17331,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,We’re not doing names now. Howard?
17332,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,"Like I was saying, right now it’s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…"
17333,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"All right, fine. If we’re not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation?"
17334,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,No.
17335,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Well, but hear me out. The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project. Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago. For our app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs."
17336,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,That’s just Sheldon backwards.
17337,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Another happy accident.
17338,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,We’re not wasting time with names right now.
17339,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,I see. Is that decision open for discussion?
17340,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,No.
17341,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?
17342,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,No.
17343,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,"Again, right now it’s just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into…"
17344,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.
17345,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"Oh Sheldon, stop it."
17346,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together…"
17347,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"That’s enough, Sheldon."
17348,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"All right, let’s get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny."
17349,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"Okay, that’s it, you’re fired."
17350,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Really? Why?
17351,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,Because you’re impossible to work with.
17352,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,I see. And is that open for discussion?
17353,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,What are you doing?
17354,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think you’ll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night."
17355,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,But I fired you.
17356,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, I know. I’m now an independent contractor."
17357,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever."
17358,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,But I made it better.
17359,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,I don’t want it better. I want it my way.
17360,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Well, that speaks volumes, doesn’t it? All right, I suppose I’ll go put on my bus pants."
17361,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,What the hell are bus pants?
17362,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"They are pants one wears over one’s regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder, you’ve lost touch with the struggles of the common man."
17363,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"Look, I’m still happy to drive you to work. Nothing’s changed in that regard. We’re still roommates, we’re still friends."
17364,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Except you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex."
17365,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,You know what? Go put on your bus pants.
17366,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,"Mm. Last night, I had a dream we got so rich from the app, you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions. But there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you think that means?"
17367,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,"It means after we play handball, I’m showering at home."
17368,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Good morning, Friend Howard. Friend Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. Perhaps they would taste better out of these."
17369,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,World’s Greatest Astrophysicist?
17370,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Don’t thank me. You earned it.
17371,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,Howard Wolowitz. Why not World’s Greatest Engineer?
17372,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"I’m sorry. I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn’t press enter. Now down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company? Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard."
17373,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,We’re not quitting on Leonard.
17374,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,I understand. And your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?
17375,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,What are you talking about?
17376,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. No? How about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? Go, Beavers. I’ll be back."
17377,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,"Okay, let’s try this one. Spherical Hankel function."
17378,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,Hold on. That’s it!
17379,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,Eureka!
17380,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,"Hey, we agreed when it was Eureka time, we were all gonna say it together."
17381,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,Fine. Let’s say it together.
17382,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,No. The moment has passed.
17383,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Greetings, gentlemen. How goes your little project?"
17384,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,"You mean, Project Lenwoloppali?"
17385,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Ah, a combination of all your names. Very clever. I assume Koothranardowitz was taken?"
17386,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,We’re actually scanning equations and getting good results.
17387,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, well then, by all means, carry on. I wouldn’t want to impede your progress."
17388,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?"
17389,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,No. It’s a little tricky. I’m gonna try having it pick up the libraries dynam…
17390,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,What are you doing?!
17391,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Playing the theremin.
17392,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?"
17393,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Playing it. I’ve loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it’s been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust."
17394,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,Sheldon! We’re working here!
17395,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,That’s all right. I can barely hear you over my theremin.
17396,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Well, that was a little uncalled for."
17397,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"No, that was completely called for. We need quiet."
17398,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"So, your project is more important than mine?"
17399,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes."
17400,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Don’t beat around the bush, Leonard. If you don’t want me here, just say the word, and I’ll leave."
17401,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Could have beaten around the bush a little.
17402,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow-ow-ow-ow."
17403,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,What you doing? Trying to contact your home planet?
17404,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,I’m practicing my theremin.
17405,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,Oh.
17406,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen. Glory, hallelujah."
17407,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Something got you down, there, Sheldon?"
17408,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. And his app team.
17409,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Oh, honey, I’m sorry."
17410,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,He wouldn’t drive me to work today. I had to wear my bus pants.
17411,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,Is that so?
17412,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Yes. And they’re still sticky.
17413,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,Aw.
17414,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Probably going to have to throw them away.
17415,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Hey, you don’t need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me."
17416,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,With you?
17417,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Seriously, I have a great idea for one."
17418,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?
17419,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them."
17420,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,That’s your app idea?
17421,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Well, you don’t like it?"
17422,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"I didn’t say that. But no, I don’t."
17423,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,Why not?
17424,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality."
17425,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,And Leonard didn’t want to work with you? Imagine that.
17426,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"I know, it’s baffling."
17427,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen.
17428,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Sheldon, I’m gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?"
17429,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Do you make it with milk or water?
17430,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,Milk.
17431,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Real cocoa?
17432,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,That’s what it says on the packet.
17433,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Do you have those little marshmallows?
17434,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"No, sorry."
17435,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Well, I suppose it’s appropriate."
17436,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,What does that mean?
17437,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.
17438,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,"Hey, look at this. 20 people from the university have already signed up for our private beta."
17439,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"I’m telling you, the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. We’ve got a hit."
17440,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,What do you think we should sell it for?
17441,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,"Well, based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys, and you want a submarine, I’d say about a million dollars a pop."
17442,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,"Well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million? You know, get the word of mouth going."
17443,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Hi. I’m sorry to bother you guys, but you’ve got to come take your Sheldon back."
17444,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,What’s he doing in your apartment?
17445,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over, and now I regret it."
17446,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"Why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question."
17447,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Look, can’t you just let him play with you until bedtime?"
17448,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,We’re not playing. This is real work.
17449,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,We’re going to be hundred-aires.
17450,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?
17451,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"Then I guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we’re doing that, you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig."
17452,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,Okay. Wait right here.
17453,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Raj,"I’ll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough, that’s the kind of girl I want to take on a submarine ride. And yes, that time, I meant it to be dirty."
17454,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Really? Leonard wants me back?
17455,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Oh, yes. He says they are lost without you."
17456,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Well, we sure saw that coming."
17457,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,That’s right.
17458,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,You know what I’m going to do? I am going to sit here and just let them stew.
17459,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"No, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough. Everybody’s suffered enough. The thing is, you’re going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this."
17460,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,How?
17461,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,Say you’re sorry.
17462,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didn’t raise her no liars."
17463,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Okay. Um, how about this? You know how you’re always trying to learn about sarcasm?"
17464,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,No.
17465,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,No?
17466,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,I was being sarcastic.
17467,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Oh. Good for you. So all you have to do here is say you’re sorry to Leonard, but say it sarcastically."
17468,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Of course. He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences, as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be."
17469,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan. All right. Come on. Let’s go."
17470,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa."
17471,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Oh, you’re welcome."
17472,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Boy, I’m getting good at this."
17473,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"Okay, now that you’re back on the team, let’s get you caught up."
17474,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behaviour and how much I respect and admire your leadership."
17475,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,"Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app."
17476,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Well, I must say, I am impressed."
17477,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Leonard,Thanks.
17478,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.
17479,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Howard,We have.
17480,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"As a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. Now, let’s start fresh. Howard, we’re going to need some tea."
17481,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Okay, these are Uggs. These are Crocs. These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks."
17482,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,Bored.
17483,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy."
17484,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Algorithm. You see, Penny, Alan Turing defined an algorithm…"
17485,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Penny,"Bored. Okay. These are Steve Maddens. These are Nine West. These are Target. Oh, but don’t they look like Chanel? These are Michael Kors. These are Roxy. These are Sachel’s. Oh, these are Betsy Johnson, they’re so cute…"
17486,4,12,the bus pants utilization,Sheldon,"Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow…"
17487,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Hey. So you guys ready to order?
17488,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o’clock and order the same exact thing, and it’s now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?"
17489,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon’s hamburger."
17490,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,"Penny, a moment? Do you have plans this weekend?"
17491,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Oh, gee, Amy, I’m sorry, I’m actually pretty busy this weekend."
17492,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,Probably serving food that was ordered today.
17493,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,That’s too bad. I was hoping you could be my plus-one at the Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies’ symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.
17494,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,The what?
17495,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,It’s an annual science conference. We’ve all been invited to speak.
17496,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Oh. Oh, okay, well, you know, like I said, I have plans, so."
17497,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,"Shame. Since you’re my best friend, I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity."
17498,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,I’m your best friend?
17499,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,Don’t you read my blog?
17500,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Oh, don’t feel bad. I never read Leonard’s, and I used to sleep with him."
17501,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in Big Sur?
17502,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"No, I really, I’m sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?"
17503,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,I think her weekend just opened up.
17504,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?"
17505,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.
17506,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"You know, it is going to be difficult, but I’m going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie."
17507,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,Please don’t touch my breasts.
17508,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"I, I wasn’t going to."
17509,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,All right. I just want to establish boundaries.
17510,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Boy, this is great. I haven’t had a vacation in ages."
17511,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"In order to take a vacation, one first has to work."
17512,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don’t piss off the people who handle the things you eat."
17513,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,That does seem to be a valid principle.
17514,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers’ Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.”
17515,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,I don’t believe there’s any such thing.
17516,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,You lied to me?
17517,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"Good morning. If I could have everyone’s attention, please? I know we’re all eager to get on the road to Big Sur, so if we focus, I’m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. Then it’s just Q&A, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo and we’re off."
17518,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"Don’t worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers."
17519,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"Raj? What are you doing? I don’t think so. You’ve had your allotted six ounces. The first bathroom break isn’t until the Denny’s located near Bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember, people, we’re only as strong as our weakest bladder."
17520,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,Nobody cares about your Kegel exercises.
17521,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"All right. We have seven people, and two cars. In the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be myself, Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny."
17522,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,"Yes! He had you in the other car, but I got you upgraded."
17523,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Yay!
17524,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild."
17525,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Brawny?
17526,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,They’re bigger than mine.
17527,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Howard, you promised."
17528,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,Fine.  Red Five to Red Leader. What do you want now?
17529,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,It’s eleven fifteen. I’m requesting your quarter-hourly location update.
17530,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,Still right behind you.
17531,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"Copy that, Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger."
17532,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"So, Amy, I’ve been wondering, are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?"
17533,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,"No, we discussed it. We decided we didn’t want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well."
17534,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone’s toilet routine.
17535,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,I can vouch for that.
17536,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Hey.
17537,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"Not you, him."
17538,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Oh. Thanks.
17539,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,Although yours was an eye-opener.
17540,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,"Don’t worry, Penny. You’re my plus-one. You’ll bunk with me. And FYI, travel makes me constipated, so I’m the ideal hotel roommate."
17541,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Terrific. Are we there yet?
17542,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,I hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.
17543,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,Really? You want to see the keynote?
17544,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,"Yeah, it sounds fun. Super bacteria global apocalypse or exciting research opportunity?"
17545,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,"Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap."
17546,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,Really? And miss the keynote?
17547,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,"We can watch it later on C-SPAN. Besides, I was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel."
17548,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,"Well honey, if you’re that tired, why don’t you just take a nap here in the car?"
17549,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,"No, see, it’s not…"
17550,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,"Hang on. It’s Leonard. Hi, Leonard."
17551,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"Yeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from Raj. He wanted me to tell you that when Howard says nap, he means sex."
17552,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,"Oh. Thank you, Raj."
17553,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,Are you an element in the actinoid series?
17554,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,No. Amy?
17555,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?
17556,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,No.
17557,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,Are you in the lanthanoid series?
17558,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"Amy, it’s Penny’s turn. Penny?"
17559,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Uh, I don’t know. Are you food?"
17560,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,That’s not apropos. We’ve already established I’m found in the periodic table.
17561,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Well, it’s a table, right? I mean, why can’t there be food on it?"
17562,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,I knew she wasn’t lead car material.
17563,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Who elected you Road Trip God?
17564,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,Leonard.
17565,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. It’s not technically Road Trip God, it’s Travel Supervisor."
17566,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.
17567,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,I don’t understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What’s he going to do?
17568,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,I can’t believe you let him kick me out of the car.
17569,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,What could we do? He’s the Travel Supervisor.
17570,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,"Don’t worry, Penny. This is a better car anyway."
17571,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,Yeah. It’s the Love Car.
17572,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Should I ask?
17573,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,"They say we’re young and we don’t know, we won’t find out until we grow."
17574,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,"Well, I don’t know if all that’s true, ’cause you got me, and, baby, I got you."
17575,4,13,the love car displacement,Together,"Babe, mm da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe, da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe…"
17576,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Red Leader, I’m really sorry."
17577,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard and Bernadette,"I got you, babe."
17578,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,I missed you.
17579,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"You know what? I missed you, too."
17580,4,13,the love car displacement,Very tall and powerfully built man,Bernadette?
17581,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,"Oh, my God, Glenn!"
17582,4,13,the love car displacement,Glenn,Great to see you!
17583,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,Are you here for the conference?
17584,4,13,the love car displacement,Glenn,"Yeah, I’m doing a global warming panel."
17585,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,"Oh, good for you. Uh, Glenn, this is my boyfriend Howard."
17586,4,13,the love car displacement,Glenn,Oh. Nice to meet you.
17587,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,Hi. Ow. Hi.
17588,4,13,the love car displacement,Glenn,You’re a lucky man. Bernie’s a great gal.
17589,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,Yes. Bernie sure is.
17590,4,13,the love car displacement,Glenn,"Well, I got to run. The panel’s tomorrow morning. It’s called, Remembering Snow A Look Back."
17591,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,I’ll try to catch it.
17592,4,13,the love car displacement,Glenn,"Oh, great. Bye."
17593,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,Bye.
17594,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,"Hey, Bernie?"
17595,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,Yeah?
17596,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,Please tell me he’s your gay cousin.
17597,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,No. He was one of my professors in college.
17598,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,Oh! That’s a relief.
17599,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,"Then we went out for a year. Come on, let’s check in, so we can take that nap."
17600,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,"No, it’s not necessarily proportional. Shut up!"
17601,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,"That green bag is Dr. Cooper’s. Here’s an extra five. Make him wait. Oh. Right to the nap, huh? Okay? Uh, so, this Glenn guy. You say you went out with him for, like, a year."
17602,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?
17603,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,"No. I guess not. What is he, like, six-four, six-five?"
17604,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,Six-seven.
17605,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,Probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.
17606,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,Is something bothering you?
17607,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,No. It’s just…
17608,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,What?
17609,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,"I’m just thinking. If you had sex with that guy, I mean, there’s nothing I can do here that will make any kind of impact."
17610,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,"Howard, it’s not a contest. I love you. I want to be with you."
17611,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,"Yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, I wouldn’t have a chance, right?"
17612,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,You can’t think that way.
17613,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,Yep. Loser.
17614,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,"Howard, stop it."
17615,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,Sorry. I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.
17616,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,"Wait a minute, a girl like me? What’s that mean?"
17617,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,I’m… I…
17618,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,Are you saying you don’t think I’m hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?
17619,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,"No! No, I’m saying exactly the opposite."
17620,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,I’m too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?
17621,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,"Yeah, let’s go with that."
17622,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,Still nothing. Remind me to try again in an hour.
17623,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Will do.
17624,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,"So, girl talk?"
17625,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?"
17626,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,Do you subscribe to the Freudian theory of penis envy?
17627,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Um, I never really thought about it. Why?"
17628,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.
17629,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Really?
17630,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,"Not for sex, for convenience. You can’t deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance."
17631,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Again, I’ve never given it much thought."
17632,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,We have time now. Think about it.
17633,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Oh, good. Hey."
17634,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,Can I stay here tonight?
17635,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Yeah. Why, what happened?"
17636,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,Howard’s a complete and total ass.
17637,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Oh, yeah, that. Come on in."
17638,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,Thanks. I’ll sleep on the floor.
17639,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,Not necessary. Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.
17640,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,We are?
17641,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,"Of course, we’re best friends."
17642,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Oh, right, right, the blog."
17643,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,"Word of warning, though. I’m prone to night terrors, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, don’t panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I’ll be fine."
17644,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Hey, can I stay here tonight?"
17645,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldon’s asleep. What’s going on?
17646,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Well, Howard’s a complete and total ass, Bernadette’s in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amy’s hair, she bites."
17647,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,What?
17648,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Never mind. Can I stay here or not?
17649,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"Uh, sure."
17650,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,All right.
17651,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"So, how do you wanna do this?"
17652,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Well, I’m not getting in bed with him."
17653,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"Yeah, it is a little like getting into Dracula’s coffin."
17654,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,We’re just gonna have to make the best of this.
17655,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"Okay, when you say make the best of it."
17656,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Sleep.
17657,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,Right. So we’ll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.
17658,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,The what?
17659,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire."
17660,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Oh, okay. Just like old times."
17661,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce."
17662,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Sweetie, let me put this in a way you’ll understand. From the waist down, my shields are up."
17663,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?"
17664,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Go to sleep.
17665,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,Good night.
17666,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,Please tell me you’re not having coitus.
17667,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,We are not having coitus.
17668,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,Can you guarantee that it won’t happen at any time during the night?
17669,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Yes.
17670,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,No.
17671,4,13,the love car displacement,TV Announcer,"Next on Turner Classic Movies, Bridget Jones’s Diary."
17672,4,13,the love car displacement,Raj,"Oh, my God, I’m crying already."
17673,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,Raj? Raj? Raj? I need to sleep here tonight.
17674,4,13,the love car displacement,Raj,Why?
17675,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in Penny’s bed, Amy bites, and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard."
17676,4,13,the love car displacement,Raj,Okay. Come on in.
17677,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Leonard, are you asleep?"
17678,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,No.
17679,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.
17680,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"Sure, no problem."
17681,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,I know it’s kinda weird.
17682,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,True dat.
17683,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,True dat?
17684,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,I’ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.
17685,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Right. Still mad at me about that?
17686,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"No. No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off."
17687,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Thank you.
17688,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"I’ve gotten a lot better at that, you know. I’ve dated four different women since we broke up and I didn’t tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies."
17689,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,Good for you.
17690,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"Okay, good night."
17691,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Good night. You know, maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!"
17692,4,13,the love car displacement,Raj,"Hey, Leonard, Sheldon kicked me out of the room, gave me your key."
17693,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,Penny’s here.
17694,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"No, we don’t want to watch Bridget Jones’s Diary!"
17695,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"Good morning and welcome to Science and Society. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD, and ScD. OMG, right? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. All right then, we’ll begin with opening remarks. Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science’s responsibility to society?"
17696,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,"Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. It’s not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one."
17697,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,"Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest  is tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry."
17698,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. But he should know that I am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.
17699,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because I’d like to weigh in.
17700,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?"
17701,4,13,the love car displacement,Raj,"Certainly. I’d like to raise two points. Number one, I think they are talking about penises. And number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass."
17702,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,I’d like to kick your little brown ass.
17703,4,13,the love car displacement,Raj,What did I do?
17704,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,"Oh, I don’t know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed."
17705,4,13,the love car displacement,Raj,I did. You said no Bridget Jones.
17706,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,We weren’t getting back together! It was a one-time thing!
17707,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,Excuse me. We’re not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.
17708,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Oh, shut up, Sheldon!"
17709,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,"Hi, bestie."
17710,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Yeah, hi."
17711,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"All right, why don’t we see if we can bring this back to topic."
17712,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,"Let me ask you something, Bernie."
17713,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,I guess not.
17714,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like Angelina Jolie?
17715,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,"Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic."
17716,4,13,the love car displacement,Howard,"What, I’m not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?"
17717,4,13,the love car displacement,Raj,I’d like to weigh in here. No.
17718,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"All right, why don’t we open it up to Q&A from the audience?"
17719,4,13,the love car displacement,Penny,"Yeah, I have a question. Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to Los Angeles tonight?"
17720,4,13,the love car displacement,Glenn,I’m driving back to L.A. tonight.
17721,4,13,the love car displacement,Bernadette,"Um, Penny, that’s Glenn. Glenn, that’s Penny."
17722,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,No!
17723,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"Red Leader to Red Five. Red Leader to Red Five. Anybody up for a little game? I spy with my little eye, a nonferrous metal."
17724,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,Must be out of range.
17725,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,"Leonard, can I ask you a question?"
17726,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,Sure.
17727,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen in my life?
17728,4,13,the love car displacement,Leonard,No. Why do you ask?
17729,4,13,the love car displacement,Amy,Because we’re going 120 miles per hour.
17730,4,13,the love car displacement,Sheldon,"All right, if no one’s going to guess, I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back."
17731,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Good evening. I’m your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause, but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that you’re the best and the brightest of this university’s doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, that’s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. ‘Cause, you see, there’s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest, my sweet patootie. All right, let’s begin. Show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don’t kid yourselves."
17732,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,"I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon’s lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect."
17733,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,"Look. Listen to this one. Does Einstein’s theory explain why time flies when you’re having fun, but when you’re listening to Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?"
17734,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,"Ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account."
17735,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
17736,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,"Apparently, if you’re Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back."
17737,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Hey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down? I can’t get on."
17738,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,"Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It’s now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces."
17739,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,Thanks. What are you guys doing?
17740,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We’re reading the reviews.
17741,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,Oh. How’d he do?
17742,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,"Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2."
17743,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"That bad, huh?"
17744,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,Read this woman’s tweet.
17745,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again
17746,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,Yeah.
17747,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader."
17748,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,"So, how’d the lecture go?"
17749,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,"In a word, triumphant."
17750,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,Really? Triumphant?
17751,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today."
17752,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Oh, please let me tell him."
17753,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,"I don’t know, I kind of promised Howard."
17754,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Tell me what?
17755,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,"Actually, we should all share the moment. Raj, if you would."
17756,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That’s rather unfair. That’s downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I’m not familiar with the acronym KMN."
17757,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,"Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now."
17758,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Well, I suppose everyone’s entitled to their own opinion. I think I’ll turn in. I didn’t want to teach those poopy heads, anyway."
17759,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,"FYI, I think that’s what Darth Vader said just before he started building the Death Star."
17760,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,Sheldon still moping?
17761,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s weird. Even though he didn’t want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard."
17762,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,"Mmm, I know the feeling. It’s like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It-It happened to a friend of mine."
17763,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,Are you guys doing okay?
17764,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,"Yeah, Leonard and I are fine, but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon."
17765,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,"Well, that shouldn’t be too hard. He’s such a cutie."
17766,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,"Thank you, but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal, like, like a labradoodle."
17767,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,Labradoodle?
17768,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,We might be starting to zero in on your problem.
17769,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,Don’t you listen to them. You’ve got plenty of sex appeal.
17770,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,You really think so?
17771,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,Yeah. You’re a hottie.
17772,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,"Well, thanks, Bernadette. And just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander."
17773,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Amy,"So, what do you think?"
17774,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"It’s a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up."
17775,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Amy,Not even when I do this?
17776,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,No.
17777,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Amy,"Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy."
17778,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I’ve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?
17779,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Amy,"If this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it."
17780,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,For instance?
17781,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Amy,"Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser."
17782,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Hmm, no. One slip of the hand, and suddenly I’m sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz."
17783,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Amy,"All right. Have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?"
17784,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Isn’t that their burden? I’m the one with something interesting to say.
17785,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Amy,"Fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. In the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage."
17786,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,I sense that you’re trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?
17787,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Amy,Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.
17788,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.
17789,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny."
17790,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,What?
17791,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"You’re an actress, correct?"
17792,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,I’m not an actress. I’m an actress.
17793,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,All right. You’re an actress. I need you to teach me.
17794,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,You want an acting lesson?
17795,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Perhaps two. I’d like to master the craft.
17796,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Okay, where is this coming from?"
17797,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one."
17798,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put ’em on my fridge."
17799,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"So, when could we start?"
17800,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn’t."
17801,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,I suppose that’s one way to look at it.
17802,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,I think it’s the only way to look at it.
17803,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Are you going to help me or not?
17804,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,Probably. I’m just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?
17805,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one’s career had reached the end of the road."
17806,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,Forget it.
17807,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,I’ll pay you 40 dollars.
17808,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Saturday, nine a.m. Bring cash."
17809,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,"Raj, I have amazing news!"
17810,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,What?
17811,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.
17812,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,"Dude, that’s incredible!"
17813,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,"I know. The only thing is, I’m gonna be gone for two years."
17814,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,"Aw, I’m gonna miss you. Are you going with him?"
17815,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,I have to stay here for school.
17816,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,"That’s what we’re here to talk to you about. You see, Bernadette has needs."
17817,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,What kind of needs?
17818,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,Sexual needs.
17819,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,"Most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up."
17820,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,"So, while I’m gone, you’re going to have to satisfy her."
17821,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,What do you say?
17822,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,I say okey-dokey.
17823,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,What ya thinking so hard about?
17824,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,Just that I’m definitely not gay.
17825,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny."
17826,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,What’s wrong?
17827,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Nothing. I was acting.
17828,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,You were acting?
17829,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Yes. In preparation for today’s studies, I read Stanislavski’s An Actor Prepares, Stella Adler’s. The Technique of Acting, Uta Hagen’s Respect for Acting, and Henry Winkler’s Heyyy, I’m an Actor."
17830,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Well, good for you. Come on in."
17831,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,How shall we begin?
17832,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Well, I thought we’d start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little."
17833,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,All right.
17834,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?"
17835,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,You said to do whatever feels natural. This feels natural. Certainly more natural than what you’re doing.
17836,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies."
17837,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other."
17838,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"All right, let’s just say we’ve warmed up."
17839,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,You’re the teacher.
17840,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don’t we try some improvisation?
17841,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Why not? It seems like you’re improvising your entire curriculum.
17842,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,This is all about listening and responding.
17843,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Gotcha.
17844,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"I’m going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it."
17845,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,All right.
17846,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,All right.
17847,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Action.
17848,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Okay, it’s not a movie. It’s improv. So no one calls action."
17849,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?"
17850,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?"
17851,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"I’d like a frozen yogurt, please."
17852,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,Yogurt?
17853,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Yeah.
17854,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here."
17855,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,You do?
17856,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Yes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes."
17857,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.
17858,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,What?
17859,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,It’s the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.
17860,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Okay, you know what? Let’s just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass."
17861,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, and we’re going to use props?"
17862,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"You bet. I had dreams, you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?"
17863,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,You have any frozen yogurt?
17864,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,I’m still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. That’s siffy.
17865,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,Uh-huh.
17866,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,"Hello? Oh, my God! Is he okay?"
17867,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,What happened?
17868,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,"Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. He’s in critical condition."
17869,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,"Oh, no!"
17870,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,Did you hear? Isn’t it terrible?
17871,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,Have you seen him?
17872,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,They wouldn’t let me in. Oh my Howie.
17873,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.
17874,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.
17875,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,"It’s Howard. Howard, hello."
17876,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,"Raj, is that you?"
17877,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,"Yeah, I’m right here, buddy. How are you?"
17878,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,"Shh, shh. Listen to me. I’m not gonna make it."
17879,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,"No, no, no, don’t say that. You’re going to be all right."
17880,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,"Raj, I don’t have time. Now, pay attention. My last wish is that you look after Bernadette."
17881,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,"Of course, of course. Now when you say look after, you mean…"
17882,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,Sexually.
17883,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,"Excuse me, Bernadette. I have to hear it from him."
17884,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Howard,Sexually.
17885,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,"Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life."
17886,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,That’s how I heard it.
17887,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,Or it could be sy-fee.
17888,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,What?
17889,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Leonard,S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.
17890,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,"Oh, right. Good one."
17891,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?"
17892,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Yes. I didn’t care for it.
17893,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic."
17894,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"So is the McRib sandwich. I don’t care for that, either."
17895,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?
17896,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,I’m glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.
17897,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,And you think it’s better than Tennessee Williams?
17898,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Why don’t we leave that for future generations to decide?
17899,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.
17900,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"It’s the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated."
17901,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,KMN.
17902,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Now, in this pivotal scene, Sheldon’s mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock, the role I will bring to life."
17903,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Okay, that’s fine, but let’s try and get you out of your comfort zone."
17904,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Why would we want to do that? It’s called the comfort zone for a reason.
17905,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I’m thinking you’ll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock."
17906,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,I’m sorry. You’ll be Spock?
17907,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,It’s only logical.
17908,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Very well. I’ll set the scene.
17909,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,All right.
17910,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"East Texas. A warm summer night. A woman, Mary, stands on a porch. In the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. Woo-woo. The droning buzz of cicadas. Zzzzzzzzz. A coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. Aw-aw-aw! Out in the woods, an owl screeches."
17911,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene."
17912,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Hoo!
17913,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,Now just read your mother’s line.
17914,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, I’ll never understand that boy. But then again, I’m a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things."
17915,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.
17916,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain’t foolin’ no one, and get your shotgun!"
17917,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Greetings, Mary Cooper. I am Spock."
17918,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I just don’t buy it.
17919,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,Just keep going!
17920,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me."
17921,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"We have been monitoring your son Sheldon from the 23rd Century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy."
17922,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"I understand. Oh, Shelly? A man’s here to take you away to the future! Be sure to pack clean underwear.”"
17923,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Okay, okay, let’s try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little."
17924,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,Why?
17925,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Well, you’re losing your son."
17926,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Yes, but he’s going to a better place where he won’t get beat up. So much."
17927,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"All right, come on, just try it my way. Pretend you’re sad to see him go. I’m gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. That’s your cue."
17928,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I just love that line. Even the way you do it.
17929,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"All right, come on, come on. Put some real emotion into it. Blah-blah, blah, blah, vast and troubled galaxy. Go."
17930,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, Shelly? A man’s here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear."
17931,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,That’s good. That’s good. That’s good.
17932,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Mommy, why are you crying? ‘Cause I’m gonna miss you, Shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me."
17933,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Okay, I guess we’re improvising now."
17934,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Well I’m sorry. It’s not my fault. I’m just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. Oh, now, don’t you start crying. You get in that spaceship. Mommy’s late for Indian bingo."
17935,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Penny,"Mrs. Cooper, hey, it’s Penny. Yeah, I think I broke your son. Hey, hold on. Talk to your mother."
17936,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Sheldon,"Mommy, I love you. Don’t let Spock take me to the future!"
17937,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,"Okay, Raj, I know you’ve been avoiding me and Howard, and I’m not leaving until you tell me what’s going on inside that little head of yours."
17938,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,Like the wild elephant I am trumpeting my love for you!
17939,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,Like a hidden flower my sweet fragrance comes into view!
17940,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,My heart burns for you like the sun at noon!
17941,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,nan
17942,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,My desert welcomes you like the rainy monsoon!
17943,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,You are my heart!
17944,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,My universe!
17945,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,You are my heart!
17946,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Bernadette,My universe!
17947,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Both together,My universe!
17948,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Chorus of everyone in cafeteria,Hey! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! My universe!
17949,4,14,the thespian catalyst,Raj,"Dance number aside, I’m so not gay."
17950,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,Here’s what I wonder about zombies.
17951,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,"What happens if they can’t get any human flesh to eat? They can’t starve to death, they’re already dead."
17952,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,You take this one. I spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can’t see themselves in the mirror?
17953,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. Case closed.
17954,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,"Yeah, okay, so, zombies."
17955,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj. Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn’t eat, they starved."
17956,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,You’re thinking of 28 Days Later. 28 Days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state
17957,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,"Hey, don’t bag on Sandra Bullock! You think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter."
17958,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve o’clock."
17959,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,Why’s the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?
17960,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Perhaps he’s emulating Shakespeare’s Henry V, who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them, to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. Course, if he’d have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails I’ve sent him on the subject of his administration, he could have saved himself the trouble."
17961,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,Or maybe he heard it’s Tator Tot Tuesday. That’s why I’m here.
17962,4,15,the benefactor factor,Dr. Seibert,"Hey, there’s my favorite geniuses! How are we doing today?"
17963,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"That depends, how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?"
17964,4,15,the benefactor factor,Seibert,"Sorry, Dr. Cooper, I forgot you have a touch phobia."
17965,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"It’s not a touch phobia, it’s a germ phobia. If you’d like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,"
17966,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,I’ll let you check me for a hernia.
17967,4,15,the benefactor factor,Seibert,"Yeah. So, listen, fellas, who’s up for a little party this Saturday night? Open bar, good eats, might even be a few pretty girls."
17968,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,Sounds great!
17969,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,I’m in!
17970,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Hold on. Just because the nice man is offering you candy, doesn’t mean you should jump into his windowless van. What’s the occasion?"
17971,4,15,the benefactor factor,Seibert,Just a little fund-raiser for the university.
17972,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.
17973,4,15,the benefactor factor,Seibert,"I understand your reticence, Dr. Cooper, and I sympathize, but the hard facts are, occasionally, we have to shake a few hands and kiss a few butts to raise money for our research."
17974,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"I don’t care, it’s demeaning. And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair. Which, by the way, is something you don’t want to attend wearing a Star Trek ensign’s uniform."
17975,4,15,the benefactor factor,Seibert,"All right, let me put it this way. You’re gonna put on a suit, you’re gonna come to this party, and you’re gonna explain your research to a bunch of old people, or I swear to God, I’ll blind you with a hot spoon, like they did to that little boy in Slumdog Millionaire."
17976,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,"Oh, you don’t want that."
17977,4,15,the benefactor factor,Seibert,"So, Saturday night! It’s gonna be off the hook."
17978,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,Ugh!
17979,4,15,the benefactor factor,Seibert,Get over it.
17980,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,"Oh, boy! Tator tots and a party invitation? What a great day!"
17981,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,There you go.
17982,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Are you sure this is right?
17983,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,"Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants;  you’ll be fine."
17984,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,"Okay, let’s go smooch some rich, wrinkled tuckus."
17985,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,"Oh, Howard, I can’t believe Bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey."
17986,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,"Excuse me, my girlfriend doesn’t pick out my clothes. My mother does."
17987,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Oh. We should get going.
17988,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,What about Sheldon?
17989,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,Sheldon is not going.
17990,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Really? What do we tell Siebert?
17991,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.
17992,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,"Sheldon, it’s Saturday night, you’ll be doing laundry."
17993,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Don’t tell him that, tell him the mask thing."
17994,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,"Hey, put your tie back in your pants."
17995,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Thanks.
17996,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,Nice place. Reminds me of my parents’ house back in New Delhi.
17997,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,You’re kidding.
17998,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,"No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is, we have more servants."
17999,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,More than this?
18000,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,"More than we can use. You see, in India, we don’t make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams."
18001,4,15,the benefactor factor,Seibert,Ah. There’s my band of brainiacs. Where’s Dr. Cooper?
18002,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,He’s tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.
18003,4,15,the benefactor factor,Seibert,"The board of directors insists he has a beautiful mind. I think he’s just bananas. Come on, let me introduce you to one of the university’s leading donors."
18004,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,I think we were misled about the cute girls.
18005,4,15,the benefactor factor,Seibert,"Mrs. Latham, I’d like you to meet three of our outstanding young researchers. This is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz."
18006,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"Well, what happened to you, Wolowitz, couldn’t stick with it long enough to get your PhD?"
18007,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,I’m an engineer. Most engineers don’t bother with a PhD. But you may be interested to know I designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for NASA.
18008,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"Got it, you’re a space plumber."
18009,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,I’m gonna go hit the bar.
18010,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,Tell me about these two.
18011,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,Do him first.
18012,4,15,the benefactor factor,Seibert,Dr. Hofstadter is representing our experimental physics program tonight. I think you’ll really enjoy hearing about his fascinating work.
18013,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,Right. Fascinate me.
18014,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..
18015,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"They’re cute when they’re about to wet themselves, aren’t they? I’ll make it easy for you. When you arrive at the lab in the morning, what sort of machine do you turn on?"
18016,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Coffee maker?
18017,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"All right, Dr. Kooth… uh, whatever it is, you’re up."
18018,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,It’s Koothrappali. I have to tinkle.
18019,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"And so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree, I stayed right here and did a load of whites."
18020,4,15,the benefactor factor,Amy,"Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude toward The Man, but, in this case, I think you’ve made a foolish mistake."
18021,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Unlikely. But make your case. Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together, and I’m not above minimizing your window."
18022,4,15,the benefactor factor,Amy,"Sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race."
18023,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,That’s it. Prepare to be minimized.
18024,4,15,the benefactor factor,Amy,"I’m not finished. All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon. How do you think I paid for my lab?"
18025,4,15,the benefactor factor,Amy,I went to Saudi Arabia and met with a prince who had an interest in neurobiology.
18026,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?
18027,4,15,the benefactor factor,Amy,"Technically, Faisal is my fiance. But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter."
18028,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page."
18029,4,15,the benefactor factor,Amy,"And consider this, without you to make the case for the physics department, the task will fall to people like Leonard and Rajesh."
18030,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,Are you trying to scare me? ‘Cause you’re succeeding.
18031,4,15,the benefactor factor,Amy,"Well, then prepare to be terrified. If your friends are unconvincing, this year’s donations might go to, say, the geology department."
18032,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!"
18033,4,15,the benefactor factor,Amy,"Or worse, it could go to the liberal arts."
18034,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,No!
18035,4,15,the benefactor factor,Amy,"Millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies."
18036,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Oh, the humanities!"
18037,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"On the bright side, I don’t think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers."
18038,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,"It was so much easier at my bar mitzvah. The old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond."
18039,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,"Oh, don’t be such gloomy Gusses. Look at the size of these shrimp! At what point do we start calling them lobsters?"
18040,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight."
18041,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"Oh, you didn’t do that badly."
18042,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Mrs. Latham, the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, ’cause it needs to warm up."
18043,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"I no longer care, dear. But don’t worry, I really enjoyed meeting you this evening."
18044,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,You’re kidding. That was good for you? ‘Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.
18045,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,Excellent! There’s nothing I like better than making smart people feel ill at ease.
18046,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Why?
18047,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"Oh, I don’t know, it’s one of the fun things you get to do when you have lots of money. Watch. Hey! Who said you could eat that shrimp? See? Fun."
18048,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"No, no, no, I’m just here for your money. I don’t want to shake anyone’s germy hands. Explain it to them, Siebert."
18049,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"I must confess I don’t understand you, President Siebert. First you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers, but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fund-raisers. Forgive me, but that sounds like a mixed message. Here we go again. If there’s simply no talking to me, why did you call? I’m sorry, someone’s on the other line. Why don’t you see if you can organize your thoughts, and we’ll try again later. Cooper-Hofstadter residence. Go for Cooper."
18050,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Good morning, Mrs. Latham. Well, yes, of course I remember you. A woman well past her prime seeking to augment her social status by doling out her late husband’s ill-gotten gains. So, how much money are you going to give me? I’m not crazy, my mother had me tested. Well, if you’re not going to give me money, then why are you calling? She wants to talk to you. Who’s crazy now?"
18051,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Hello, Mrs. Latham. Yes, I live with him. I don’t, I, I really don’t know why. Tonight? Sure, that’d be great. Okay, I’ll, I’ll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research."
18052,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?"
18053,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Well, wherever we’re going, she’s sending a car to pick me up."
18054,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Okay, I see what’s happening."
18055,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,What?
18056,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"My stature intimidates her, so she’s using you to get to me. Crafty old gal."
18057,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. I’ve been published in peer-reviewed journals, I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics."
18058,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"No, that can’t be it. And since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is we’re best friends. And I got your back, Jack."
18059,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,That was a great meal.
18060,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,I’m glad you enjoyed it.
18061,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,The only time I eat this well is when my mom’s in town and she takes me out to dinner.
18062,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,Is that so?
18063,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"You kind of remind me of her. She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too."
18064,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"Well, you remind me of a boy I dated in college."
18065,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,No kidding.
18066,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,Sweet boy. Very smart. If only he’d had money.
18067,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Yeah, um, so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?"
18068,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"Well, I must say, you make a very persuasive case for it."
18069,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Oh, good, good."
18070,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,And I’m seriously considering taking it to the next level.
18071,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Terrific. Great. What level is that?
18072,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Okay, now you don’t remind me of my mom."
18073,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?"
18074,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,"Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching."
18075,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"You know, it’s a shame, all that work she’s doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive."
18076,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,Hey. How was dinner?
18077,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?
18078,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"No. But we have potatoes, I could make you vodka. It’ll take two weeks."
18079,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,"Leonard, are you okay?"
18080,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Um, I’m not sure."
18081,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,What’s going on?
18082,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump."
18083,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Oh, wow!"
18084,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,Yes!
18085,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
18086,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,Why?
18087,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,"Okay, we can’t keep explaining everything. Read that book we got you."
18088,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,She hit on me.
18089,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,Wait-wait-wait. Are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?
18090,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,I think so.
18091,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,You lucky duck.
18092,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,"You’re really a broken toy, aren’t you?"
18093,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night."
18094,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,Excellent! What are you planning to wear?
18095,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,What?
18096,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Penny, you’re an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this."
18097,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Well, n-no, hold on a second, I’m not going to sleep with her."
18098,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
18099,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Well, forget it! It’s not gonna happen."
18100,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Well, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!"
18101,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"I repeat, not gonna happen."
18102,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,What was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?
18103,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,It was a compliment. I believe in giving credit where credit is due.
18104,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Okay, fine. I’ll tell him. Leonard, Mrs. Latham’s car is here for you."
18105,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,I won’t be too late. I’m just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.
18106,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Hold on, I have something for you."
18107,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,What’s this?
18108,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Just a few things you may need tonight. There’s, uh, baby oil, condoms and, uh, a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology. They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M."
18109,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,I am not going to have sex with her.
18110,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!
18111,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Are you insane? I’m not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.
18112,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Oh, come on! Why not?"
18113,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Good night, Sheldon."
18114,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!"
18115,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,"He still won’t shag the old lady, huh?"
18116,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,No. But thank you for asking.
18117,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Hey. Hi.
18118,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"Hello, Leonard. I hope you’re hungry."
18119,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"I’m very hungry. For food, right?"
18120,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"Oh, I made you uncomfortable last night. I’m so sorry."
18121,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"No, that’s okay."
18122,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"No, it most certainly is not. Leonard, I’m making the donation to your department regardless of what happens between us."
18123,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Really?
18124,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"Well, of course. There’s no quid pro quo here. You and your colleagues are doing remarkable research, and you deserve the money."
18125,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Oh. Then what was last night about?
18126,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"I took a shot, sue me."
18127,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Oh.
18128,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"You’re a very handsome man, Leonard."
18129,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Thank you.
18130,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,It was foolish of me to think someone your age might ever be interested in someone like me.
18131,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Oh, don’t say that. You’re a very attractive woman."
18132,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"Oh, please."
18133,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"No, it’s true."
18134,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"Well, aren’t you sweet. Just for the record, you’d remember a night with me for the rest of your life."
18135,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"I’m sure I would. But why, why, exactly?"
18136,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,You’re a very smart man. How do you think I landed such a rich husband?
18137,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,I hadn’t really given it much thought.
18138,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,"Well, think about it."
18139,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Do you mean?
18140,4,15,the benefactor factor,Mrs Latham,Yep. I’m that good.
18141,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Oh, what the hell."
18142,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,"Good morning, slut."
18143,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,What?
18144,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,"Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it. All you’re missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it."
18145,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,What’s going on?
18146,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Oh, nothing’s going on. Excuse me."
18147,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,Are you just getting home?
18148,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,Yeah.
18149,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"That’s a good sign, right?"
18150,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,"Oh, yeah."
18151,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,I’m so proud of you! You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!
18152,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"No, I didn’t do it for the money."
18153,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,She stiffed you?
18154,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,I believe that’s what your roommate did to her.
18155,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,What?
18156,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,"Again, read the book we gave you."
18157,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"No, I mean, I, I, I got the money first."
18158,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"Smart. Get paid up front. Yeah, I think you have a real knack for gigolo work, Leonard."
18159,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,"Uh, I’m gonna go lie down."
18160,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,"That’s a good idea, get your rest. There are a lot more rich old ladies out there, and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator. And I thought he didn’t learn anything from his relationship with you."
18161,4,15,the benefactor factor,Penny,Hey!
18162,4,15,the benefactor factor,Sheldon,Another compliment! Learn to recognize them.
18163,4,15,the benefactor factor,Seibert,"Ah, there he is! The man of the hour! He took one for the team!"
18164,4,15,the benefactor factor,Leonard,I didn’t do it for the money!
18165,4,15,the benefactor factor,Seibert,"Keep telling yourself that, it makes it easier. Trust me, I know."
18166,4,15,the benefactor factor,Raj,"Cool, buddy! That’s awesome!"
18167,4,15,the benefactor factor,Howard,How was she?
18168,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,What’s so funny?
18169,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,Nothing. Just thinking about the noises people make during sex.
18170,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don’t I?"
18171,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,It’s cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
18172,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,You know it’s meant as a compliment.
18173,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,That’s how I take it.
18174,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,This is perfect. I hope this moment never ends.
18175,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,Me too.
18176,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"Well, gotta go."
18177,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,Oh! Already? Why don’t you stay over?
18178,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"Well, I’d love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning."
18179,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,"Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself."
18180,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"It’s not just the wig. It’s pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. It’s a two-person job."
18181,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,"It’s just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel cheap."
18182,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"Oh, honey, I’m sorry. What can I do?"
18183,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,Stay.
18184,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"Okay. Like, what, another five, ten minutes?"
18185,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,Go home.
18186,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,Your call.
18187,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,"Howard, have you ever considered us living together?"
18188,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"Boy, I don’t know. You, me, Ma living under the same roof?"
18189,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,"No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place."
18190,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,I’ve got a better solution.
18191,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,What?
18192,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"We wait for my mom’s heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom."
18193,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,Great.
18194,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,Look at us planning a future together.
18195,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Mrs Wolowitz,Who’s there? Are you a sex criminal?
18196,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"Sex criminals don’t have keys, Ma."
18197,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Mrs Wolowitz,Where were you so late?
18198,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,I was out with Bernadette.
18199,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Mrs Wolowitz,"I know what that means, I watch Dr. Phil. I hope to God you used a condom!"
18200,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"I’m not having this conversation with you, Ma!"
18201,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Mrs Wolowitz,God forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases!
18202,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,Nobody has a disease!
18203,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Mrs Wolowitz,I hope not. I share a toilet with you. Is that what you want? To give your mother herpes?
18204,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,That’s it. I don’t have to take this. Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!
18205,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Mrs Wolowitz,Who’s there? Are you a sex criminal?
18206,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,I’m still leaving! I just forgot my Claritin.
18207,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,"Hey, what’s up?"
18208,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,I need a place to crash.
18209,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,"Uh, sure. Why?"
18210,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,Big fight with my mother.
18211,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,Still arguing over which CSI is the best?
18212,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette."
18213,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,What’s going on?
18214,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,Howard’s gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.
18215,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,Did you offer him a hot beverage?
18216,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,No.
18217,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,"Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea."
18218,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,Tea does sound nice.
18219,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,"You heard the man, Leonard. And while you’re at it, I’m upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn’t you seek refuge under his roof?"
18220,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,There’s no room. His sister is staying with him.
18221,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,"Wait, wait. What?"
18222,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,"Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I’m down in the dumps here."
18223,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,Priya’s in town?
18224,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"Yeah, some work thing. Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette…"
18225,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,Hold on. When did Priya get here?
18226,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"I don’t know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesn’t like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn’t trust Bernadette."
18227,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,"Yeah, that’s a real pickle. Bye."
18228,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,"Don’t worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you."
18229,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,That’s not really necessary.
18230,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,"No, no. I’ll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever’s troubling you."
18231,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,Thanks.
18232,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,That’s what tertiary friends are for.
18233,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,Who is it?
18234,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,It’s Leonard.
18235,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,You can’t come in.
18236,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,I just want to talk to her.
18237,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,I forbid it.
18238,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,"Open the door, Rajesh."
18239,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,You heard me. I forbidded it.
18240,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,Forbidded it?
18241,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,Forbaded it?
18242,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,Get out of the way. What are you doing here?
18243,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,What are you doing here?
18244,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,I have business in Los Angeles.
18245,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,Why didn’t you call?
18246,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,"Clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, Mike."
18247,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,"I’m sorry. I thought about calling, but I just wasn’t sure if seeing you was such a good idea."
18248,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?
18249,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,No!
18250,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,Sure.
18251,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,"It’s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I’ll be right out here monitoring the situation!"
18252,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,"Oh, damn it. Leonard, when you get this message, call me."
18253,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,"Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail."
18254,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because you’re welcome to.
18255,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"That’s very nice of you, but I made other plans."
18256,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,"Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready."
18257,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,"Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon."
18258,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,Hey.
18259,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,Hello.
18260,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.
18261,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,"Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together."
18262,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,"Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex."
18263,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,The word is forbade.
18264,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.
18265,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,"Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided to see each other again, and you don’t get to tell me who I can and can’t have a relationship with."
18266,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,"Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman’s father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard."
18267,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,"There it is, Priya. We’re Indian. We believe this stuff."
18268,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,"I think it also says that if you eat beef, you need to live with cows for three months and drink their urine."
18269,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,"Some of it makes sense, some of it’s crazy. My point is, you can’t go out with Leonard."
18270,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,Who can’t go out with Leonard?
18271,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,My sister.
18272,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,"Penny, this is Raj’s sister, Priya."
18273,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,It’s very nice to meet you.
18274,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,"Oh, yeah, you, too."
18275,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,"Priya, if you’re experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants."
18276,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,Sheldon!
18277,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,Really?
18278,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?"
18279,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,Sure.
18280,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,"Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?"
18281,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"Listen, my mom’s going to Palm Springs to visit her sister. That’s two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case I’ll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier."
18282,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,"That’s it? That’s your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom’s nose holds up, we get two nights together?"
18283,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,Isn’t that great?
18284,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,"No, it’s not great. You need to make a choice. Me or your mother."
18285,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"Oh, uh…"
18286,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,Wrong answer.
18287,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"No, wait. You didn’t let me finish."
18288,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,I’m listening.
18289,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,Uh…
18290,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,Agh!
18291,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,I came as quickly as I could.
18292,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,Okay. Why?
18293,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,"To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh’s sister. So I high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart."
18294,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,"Amy, I’m fine."
18295,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,"You don’t have to be strong for me. Now let’s talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch."
18296,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,What?
18297,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,"In situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. Rawr."
18298,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,"Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya."
18299,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,Oh. Then perhaps you don’t understand what’s going on. Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. Arguably much more suitable than you.
18300,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,"Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, more suitable?"
18301,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,"Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, she’s an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows."
18302,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,"Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?"
18303,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,"This is a portable electroencephalogram. I’m doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then I’m going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. Cool, huh?"
18304,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,I choose you.
18305,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,Really?
18306,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,Yep. I moved out of my mother’s house. Cord is cut. I’m all yours.
18307,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,What did she say when you told her?
18308,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,I don’t know. She hasn’t responded to my email yet.
18309,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,"This is so great. I love you, Howard."
18310,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"I love you, too. So what’s for dinner?"
18311,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,"Well, I don’t really have much of anything in the house."
18312,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,That’s fine. Why don’t we go fool around in our bedroom? And then you can go shopping.
18313,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,"I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie."
18314,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,I’d love that.
18315,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,"I love the way you say, I’d love that."
18316,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,She says it the same way I do. I’d love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It’s not a big deal.
18317,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,"Rajesh, don’t be a child."
18318,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,"I’m not being a child. Leonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her."
18319,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,My sister’s 38 and married.
18320,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Raj,All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.
18321,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,"Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza."
18322,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,"That’s remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nation’s airports."
18323,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,"Hi. Penny, right?"
18324,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,"Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I’m sorry. I didn’t know you had company. I don’t want to impose."
18325,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,"No, no. It’s not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it."
18326,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,"If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldn’t have to take that."
18327,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,"Hi, bestie."
18328,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,"Hi. So, um, Priya, you’re a lawyer, right?"
18329,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,"I know. Pretty boring, huh?"
18330,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,"Oh, come on. It’s not boring at all. She’s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?"
18331,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,"Thank you, Leonard. That doesn’t make it sound boring at all."
18332,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,"So, how you holding up?"
18333,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,I’m fine.
18334,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,"Oh, who are you kidding? She’s breathtaking."
18335,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,"So, Penny, Leonard tells me you’re an actress. That must be pretty exciting."
18336,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,"Oh, yeah, yeah. It’s real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn."
18337,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,Did you get the part?
18338,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,I didn’t do the audition.
18339,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,"Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?"
18340,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,I took acting classes when I was at Cambridge. I loved it. We did Taming of the Shrew.
18341,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,"Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail."
18342,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,In his tongue.
18343,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,Whose tongue?
18344,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Priya,"Yours, if you talk of tails, and so farewell."
18345,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Leonard,"What, with my tongue in your tail?"
18346,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,I’m regretting my earlier cattiness. She is an absolute delight.
18347,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,Wow.
18348,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"Wow, indeed."
18349,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,I can’t believe we’re finally living together.
18350,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?
18351,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,What?
18352,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,A little snack. You got any string cheese?
18353,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,"No. I, I might have some cheddar."
18354,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,Not as good. You can’t make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.
18355,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,Okay.
18356,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,You have hypo-allergenic detergent?
18357,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,No.
18358,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus."
18359,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,Wait a second. I’m doing your laundry?
18360,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"Well, honey, it’s not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you’re driving me to the dentist."
18361,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,I have to take you?
18362,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,You don’t have to take me. You get to take me.
18363,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?
18364,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,It’s not weird. There’s lots of kids there with their moms.
18365,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,I can’t believe this.
18366,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"What? It’s fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat."
18367,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Bernadette,"All right, Howard, let’s get something straight right now. I’m not going to be your mother."
18368,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?"
18369,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Mrs Wolowitz,Who’s that? Is it a sex criminal?
18370,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,"Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma."
18371,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Mrs Wolowitz,Where were you?
18372,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,Didn’t you read my email?
18373,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Mrs Wolowitz,You know I can’t turn on that ferkakta computer. I left you some brisket on the kitchen counter.
18374,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Howard,Thank you.
18375,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Mrs Wolowitz,Remember to floss after. We have the dentist in the morning!
18376,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,"Oh, hey. What’s up?"
18377,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,I just wanted to check in on you.
18378,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,Why?
18379,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,"It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one’s best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger."
18380,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,"I already told you, I’m okay with it. I mean, if anything, I’m quite pleased that Leonard has found someone that makes him so happy."
18381,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,"It’s okay, it’s okay."
18382,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,Thank you.
18383,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,"Now, let’s get these electrodes attached and see what’s going on in that pretty little noggin of yours."
18384,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,Okay.
18385,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,I smell Chinese food.
18386,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,It’s actually Thai. You’re slipping.
18387,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,Are Leonard and Priya here?
18388,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,They went to Catalina for the weekend.
18389,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,Oh. Where’s Raj?
18390,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,"At home, forbidding it."
18391,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,How about Howard?
18392,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,I’m given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.
18393,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,"Oh, okay. Well, I guess it’s just the two of us, huh?"
18394,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,"Actually, it’s the three of us."
18395,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,"What up, bestie? Good news. Thanks to you, I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist."
18396,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,Great.
18397,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,"So, you feeling better?"
18398,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,Not really.
18399,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Amy,"Sheldon, you have a guest who’s upset."
18400,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,Right. I’ll make tea.
18401,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Penny,"Oh, sweetie, it’s okay. I don’t want tea."
18402,4,16,the cohabitation formulation,Sheldon,I’m sorry. It’s not optional.
18403,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Buona sera, Luigi’s Pizza. Buona sera. It means good evening in Italian. May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?"
18404,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,"Okay, I’m out of here."
18405,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Un momento. Oh, for heaven’s sake, now you’re being deliberately stupid."
18406,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Where are you going?
18407,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,I’m having dinner with Priya at Raj’s. I think Howard’s going to be there. You want to join us?
18408,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"But tonight’s Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan."
18409,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,Can’t we make a one-time exception for tonight?
18410,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic."
18411,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,Just come with me to Raj’s.
18412,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Well, I don’t want to go to a party."
18413,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,"It’s not a party. It’s the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there."
18414,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party."
18415,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,How come it’s not a party when we do it here?
18416,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Because we don’t throw parties.
18417,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,"I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon. I’m going to see Priya. Everyone’s over there. You coming or not?"
18418,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you."
18419,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,I guess you’re right. See you later.
18420,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?
18421,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,Come with me to Raj’s and eat there.
18422,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,I can’t do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?
18423,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,I really doubt that’s what he’ll serve.
18424,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"But what if he does? I’ll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep’s stomach. And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I don’t know why he’s serving both."
18425,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,"What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?"
18426,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"No, I’ll go to your haggis party. But I’m telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness."
18427,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Oh, dear!"
18428,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,What?
18429,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Raj’s television. I just realized we’re about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.
18430,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,So don’t watch TV. Read a book.
18431,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"And be a social pariah? Oh, you know that’s not my style."
18432,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,Ugh!
18433,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?"
18434,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,Right.
18435,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Is it about me or the dead pixels?
18436,4,17,the toast derivation,Raj,"Hey, you’re just in time. We made Tex-Mex."
18437,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,"Oh, sounds great."
18438,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza."
18439,4,17,the toast derivation,Priya,"Hey, you."
18440,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,Hi.
18441,4,17,the toast derivation,Howard,"That’s got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister’s mouth?"
18442,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit."
18443,4,17,the toast derivation,Priya,"There is no assigned seats, Sheldon. Just sit anywhere. Make yourself comfortable."
18444,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Oh, what fun. We’re like hippies at a love-in."
18445,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,Just sit here.
18446,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it’s Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer’s Stone."
18447,4,17,the toast derivation,Raj,"Okay, we’ve got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own."
18448,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required."
18449,4,17,the toast derivation,Priya,"Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?"
18450,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?
18451,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?"
18452,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.
18453,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,Where are all your friends?
18454,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl."
18455,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,Okay.
18456,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Excuse me? Isn’t this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?
18457,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. What’s troubling you, buddy?"
18458,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"I don’t think your heart’s in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj’s sister, we’re all forced to hang out at his apartment."
18459,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Oh, the horror."
18460,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula."
18461,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?"
18462,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,Ugh!
18463,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Wonder what she’s exasperated about. Hello?
18464,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,"Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from Raj’s, but according to Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory."
18465,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn’t look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it."
18466,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,Wise.
18467,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.
18468,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,"Hi, bestie."
18469,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?"
18470,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,"Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose."
18471,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Yeah, it’s a great time to be alive, isn’t it?"
18472,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Don’t worry. My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.
18473,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying with Raj. That means you’re all probably gonna be hanging out there more."
18474,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,"Penny, I’m sorry you got dragged into this. I know you’re devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin."
18475,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Okay, I’m not upset about Leonard and Priya."
18476,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.
18477,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Cluck-cluck-cluck.
18478,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,"Sheldon, look at me. I think it’s time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he goes, the group goes."
18479,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I’m the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.
18480,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,I’m not saying that you’re not fun. You’re the most fun person I know.
18481,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,A lot of people think I’m fun to be around.
18482,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,"Don’t be needy, bestie. That’s probably part of what chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we’d all be singing Hooray for Leonardwood."
18483,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you’d be called Leonard and the Leonards."
18484,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,So needy.
18485,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,What you doing?
18486,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,I’m setting out snacks.
18487,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,You do realize everyone’s eating at Raj’s again tonight?
18488,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"I didn’t say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?"
18489,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,You’re having people over?
18490,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine, I’ll tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore, Barry Kripke from the university, Penny’s ex-boyfriend Zack and TV’s LeVar Burton."
18491,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,Really? LeVar Burton’s coming here?
18492,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Possibly. I Tweeted him.
18493,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,"Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek."
18494,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends."
18495,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,Of course. Good night.
18496,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Leonard.
18497,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,Yeah?
18498,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"We had a good run, you and I."
18499,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,Okay.
18500,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,But change is a part of life.
18501,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,It certainly is.
18502,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Okay. I have guests coming. I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to leave now.
18503,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,I am leaving.
18504,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Don’t make this harder than it is, Leonard."
18505,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,"Good-bye, Sheldon."
18506,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"And good-bye to you, sir. He’ll be back."
18507,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,Of course I’ll be back. I live here!
18508,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Well, it would appear LeVar Burton won’t be joining us so let’s get started. Um, I thought we’d begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we’re here. Okay. I’m Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no introduction. If you’re not familiar with that publication, there’s a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?"
18509,4,17,the toast derivation,Stuart,"Um. Hi. I’m Stuart. I run a comic bookstore, which for financial reasons, I’m currently living in. And I guess what I’m hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower."
18510,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"That’s very nice, Stuart. Zack?"
18511,4,17,the toast derivation,Zack,"I’m Zack, and I’m, uh… uh… could you come back to me?"
18512,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Of course. Barry?
18513,4,17,the toast derivation,Barry,"I’m Barry Kwipke, and I’m here because you told me there was going to be a whaffle. When is the whaffle?"
18514,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffle… the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly."
18515,4,17,the toast derivation,Barry,One more question…
18516,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Yes, you must be present to win."
18517,4,17,the toast derivation,Zack,"Okay, I’m ready. I’m Zack, and I’m, uh… oh, crap, why is this so hard?"
18518,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Oh, hey."
18519,4,17,the toast derivation,Bernadette,Hi.
18520,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,"Yo, P-dog."
18521,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,What’s up?
18522,4,17,the toast derivation,Bernadette,We’re here to kidnap you for a girls’ night out.
18523,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,"Parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully."
18524,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,I kind of figured that.
18525,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.
18526,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,No.
18527,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,"She used to be much more fun, until Leonard punched her in the heart."
18528,4,17,the toast derivation,Bernadette,"We just thought you might want to go out and have a good time, maybe go dancing."
18529,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Oh. Gee, thanks, but I’m not really in the mood."
18530,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.
18531,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?"
18532,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,Yes.
18533,4,17,the toast derivation,Bernadette,Sure.
18534,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,All right. I’ll go change. Come on in.
18535,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,"If you’d have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn’t have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber."
18536,4,17,the toast derivation,Zack,"Anyway, after we get done snowboarding, I go back to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi. There’s no one around, so naturally, I’m free-balling it. Next thing I know, this beautiful chick shows up, drunk out of her skull, wants to get in with me."
18537,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?
18538,4,17,the toast derivation,Barry,Weally? That’s your question?
18539,4,17,the toast derivation,Zack,What’s the difference?
18540,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis."
18541,4,17,the toast derivation,Zack,"Is that like all thumbs are fingers, but not all fingers are thumbs?"
18542,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Surprisingly, yes."
18543,4,17,the toast derivation,Zack,"Nice. Now, what exactly are toes?"
18544,4,17,the toast derivation,Stuart,Can you please get back to the drunk girl? I’d like something to think about in the shower.
18545,4,17,the toast derivation,Zack,"Oh, yeah. Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes, climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice…"
18546,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,The water level rose.
18547,4,17,the toast derivation,Zack,No.
18548,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Of course it did. It’s said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath."
18549,4,17,the toast derivation,Barry,"Tewwific. Go ahead, Zack. Naked dwunk girl, fwee-balling, continue."
18550,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Forgive me, but I think you’ll find my story is more interesting."
18551,4,17,the toast derivation,Barry,Does yours have wet bweasts in it?
18552,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose."
18553,4,17,the toast derivation,Zack,"So, long story short, I nailed her."
18554,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"When he finished, he shouted Eureka!"
18555,4,17,the toast derivation,Zack,"No, I always shout, Holy Moly! Don’t know why. Just do."
18556,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Who’s ready to play some vintage video games? And tonight’s selections include ColecoVision’s Smurf Rescue in Gargamel’s Castle, Atari’s Cookie Monster Munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. I’m fun."
18557,4,17,the toast derivation,Barry,"That all sucks the big haiwy meatball. How about I go get the kawaoke machine out of my car, get plastered and blow the woof off this place?"
18558,4,17,the toast derivation,Zack,"Great, I’ll make a beer run."
18559,4,17,the toast derivation,Stuart,And I’ll take a shower. We’ll meet back here in fifteen.
18560,4,17,the toast derivation,Barry,Check.
18561,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,I’m unhappy.
18562,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,This is delicious. Where’d you learn to make chili?
18563,4,17,the toast derivation,Priya,"When I was at university in England, my flatmate was from Texas."
18564,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,I hope she wasn’t anything like my flatmate from Texas.
18565,4,17,the toast derivation,Priya,"Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn’t he?"
18566,4,17,the toast derivation,Howard,"Oh, please. That crazy bastard’s looking at quirky in the rearview mirror."
18567,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,"Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets."
18568,4,17,the toast derivation,Howard,"Raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?"
18569,4,17,the toast derivation,Priya,"Oh, God, you’re kidding."
18570,4,17,the toast derivation,Raj,"Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you weren’t so distracted by sick children in Africa, you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.”"
18571,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.
18572,4,17,the toast derivation,Raj,I’d like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.
18573,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,"Hear, hear."
18574,4,17,the toast derivation,Howard,Cheers. You realize that’s the first time we’ve ever done that without having to listen to Sheldon tell us why it’s called a toast?
18575,4,17,the toast derivation,Priya,Why is it called a toast?
18576,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,"Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls."
18577,4,17,the toast derivation,Raj,Sheldon tells it better.
18578,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,He kind of does.
18579,4,17,the toast derivation,Howard,Yeah.
18580,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,"Aw, hell, I miss him."
18581,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"So, where do you guys want to go dancing?"
18582,4,17,the toast derivation,Bernadette,We were hoping you’d know a place.
18583,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,"Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh."
18584,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Oh, yeah, I know that place. What do you think?"
18585,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,"That should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant."
18586,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Okay, let’s go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy."
18587,4,17,the toast derivation,Bernadette,"But you could if you wanted to, right?"
18588,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Well, yeah, I guess."
18589,4,17,the toast derivation,Bernadette,"Pick out the hottest guy in the room, take him home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?"
18590,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,More or less.
18591,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,What’s that like?
18592,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"I don’t know. It’s fun while you’re doing it. And then after, it’s mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret."
18593,4,17,the toast derivation,Bernadette,I would take that deal all day long.
18594,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Yeah, well, it’s not gonna happen tonight. You know, for the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and I’m totally okay with it."
18595,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,"You know, if being on your own is new to you, I’d be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I’ve perfected over the years. For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?"
18596,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Um, no."
18597,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,You should get one.
18598,4,17,the toast derivation,Bernadette,What’s that?
18599,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.
18600,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Oh, it’s a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year."
18601,4,17,the toast derivation,Bernadette,"Oh, God, that is so romantic."
18602,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Yeah, it was."
18603,4,17,the toast derivation,Bernadette,Leonard’s really one of a kind.
18604,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,"Saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavy-handed, don’t you think?"
18605,4,17,the toast derivation,Penny,"Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Let’s go find me a heinie to bite."
18606,4,17,the toast derivation,Amy,"Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard."
18607,4,17,the toast derivation,Bernadette,That’s kind of creepy.
18608,4,17,the toast derivation,Stuart,Anybody do Walking on Sunshine yet?
18609,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,No.
18610,4,17,the toast derivation,Stuart,Dibs.
18611,4,17,the toast derivation,Priya,"I’m sorry, Sheldon bought a loom and learned how to weave?"
18612,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching serapes.
18613,4,17,the toast derivation,Raj,I still wear mine when there’s a nip in the air.
18614,4,17,the toast derivation,Priya,"Now, was this before or after he adopted the 25 cats?"
18615,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.
18616,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"All my friends, All my friends, All my friends."
18617,4,17,the toast derivation,Howard,I think it’s like Beetlejuice. We said his name too many times.
18618,4,17,the toast derivation,Raj,Come on in.
18619,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Thank you.
18620,4,17,the toast derivation,Leonard,Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.
18621,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.
18622,4,17,the toast derivation,Priya,"Come here, Sheldon. Sit here with me."
18623,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Thank you.
18624,4,17,the toast derivation,Priya,Would you like some homemade chili?
18625,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,Are there beans in it?
18626,4,17,the toast derivation,Priya,Yes.
18627,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Then it’s not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but you’re from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven."
18628,4,17,the toast derivation,Priya,"Sheldon, do you want some or not?"
18629,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Yes, please. Your girlfriend’s a little short-tempered."
18630,4,17,the toast derivation,Raj,"I’d like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky."
18631,4,17,the toast derivation,All,Cheers.
18632,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,"Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?"
18633,4,17,the toast derivation,Priya,"Actually, I do. I believe the Romans used to put spiced toast in their punch bowls."
18634,4,17,the toast derivation,Sheldon,She’s also a bit of a know-it-all. Mmm. This is good. Whatever it is.
18635,4,17,the toast derivation,LeVar Burton,"Hello? I… Oh, I don’t think so. I am so done with Twitter."
18636,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,Morning.
18637,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Morning.
18638,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,Sleep okay?
18639,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Mm-hmm. Great. Hey, can I ask you something?"
18640,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,Sure.
18641,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?"
18642,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,"Yeah, just because you’re in bed with an Indian woman, you think that gives you permission to use crazy positions from an ancient Indian love manual?"
18643,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, I’d be okay with that."
18644,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,"No, you have such beautiful eyes. Have you ever thought about getting contacts?"
18645,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used to them.
18646,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,"Oh, that’s too bad."
18647,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case."
18648,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,"If you had them on now, you could see what we’re going to do next."
18649,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Th-th-th-that’s okay. I can infer from context.
18650,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick I’ve been working on?"
18651,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted, you’re just an engineer, but that doesn’t mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else’s Nobel prize acceptance speech."
18652,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Raj,"Is the trick making him disappear? Sure, let’s see it."
18653,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"Here, shuffle these."
18654,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Raj,Okay.
18655,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"Now spread them out on the table face down. Pick one, look at it."
18656,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Raj,Okay.
18657,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"Now remember your card, put it back in the deck."
18658,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,Is it any wonder he doesn’t have a doctorate?
18659,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"Remind me, what’s your birthday?"
18660,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Raj,October sixth.
18661,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"Okay, October is the tenth month. So ten, one plus zero is one, plus six is seven. Turn over the seventh card."
18662,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Raj,How about that!
18663,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,Is that your card?
18664,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Raj,"Yes, it is. Very cool!"
18665,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,It’s not cool. It’s a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. How’d you do it?
18666,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.
18667,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,Fine. Give me a second.
18668,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?"
18669,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Random man,"Oh, hey!"
18670,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Sorry! Oop!
18671,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Sorry! Pardon me! Oh, I’m so sorry! My fault! Check it out. I just got contacts."
18672,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"One, two, three, four, five. No way."
18673,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"That’s your card, right?"
18674,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,Seven of clubs! That is amazing!
18675,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,It’s not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.
18676,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"Oh, really? So how did I do it?"
18677,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"Well, I don’t care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked."
18678,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,I thought you had more important things to think about.
18679,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards."
18680,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun."
18681,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?
18682,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Hey, guys, what do you think? Priya took me clothes shopping."
18683,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Hey, you look great. Good for you, Priya. I could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were… well, you look great."
18684,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Thank you.
18685,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,Lets go hang everything up.
18686,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, good. New contacts. I should have done this years ago."
18687,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?
18688,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,I’m not going out with him. He can sleep with whoever he wants.
18689,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"Yeah, I was talking to Raj."
18690,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,Oopsy.
18691,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,This deck is rigged in some fashion.
18692,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,Fine. Get another deck and I’ll do the trick with that.
18693,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,So you’re saying this is a regulation deck?
18694,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"I’m saying believe in magic, you muggle."
18695,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"You know, well, I’m happy Leonard’s found someone. Not that anybody asked."
18696,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,How many Star Trek uniforms do you have?
18697,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Just two. Everyday and dress.
18698,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,"Uh-huh. Listen, we need to talk about something."
18699,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Oh, my god, you’re breaking up with me! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so cruel."
18700,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,"Leonard, I’m not breaking up with you."
18701,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Oh, okay. So, what’s up?"
18702,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,"It’s a little weird, your ex-girlfriend hanging out here all the time."
18703,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash."
18704,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,"I’m just saying, how would you feel if I was hanging out with my ex-boyfriend?"
18705,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Um, not great, I guess. But Penny and I are just friends."
18706,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,"I don’t care. This is a woman you have slept with. If you want her around, then I have to wonder if maybe you’re not ready to move on."
18707,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"No, no-no-no, I’m ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If that’s not moving on, what is?"
18708,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,You need to cut the cord with Penny.
18709,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Oh. Okay.
18710,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,You don’t sound very confident.
18711,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"No, no, I’m confident. It’s not like I’m unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the first time I’ll be the one saying it."
18712,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,Thank you. I appreciate it.
18713,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically, if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?"
18714,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,"Leonard, it is a source of great pain to me and my family that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe. Can we not discuss it?"
18715,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"I’m sorry. I’m, never mind."
18716,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,And was your card the jack of diamonds?
18717,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Oh, unbelievable! Know how he did it yet?"
18718,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,Um…
18719,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can’t figure out how I got his nose."
18720,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"You know, I have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed. Like, ooh, look! The pencil’s rubber!"
18721,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick."
18722,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"Oh, oh, please, if I don’t know, you don’t know. That’s axiomatic."
18723,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,Come here.
18724,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,You’re right.
18725,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,Not too bad for someone who doesn’t know what axiomatic means.
18726,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Oh, hi."
18727,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Hey, you. What happened with the contacts?"
18728,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,One of them’s upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.
18729,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Hey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?"
18730,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Yeah.
18731,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,You don’t wanna wash that.
18732,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,No?
18733,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"No, that’s silk. Seriously, what would you do without me?"
18734,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Yeah.
18735,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"You know, I gotta tell you, I think you got a real winner with Priya."
18736,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, me, too."
18737,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"She seems really sweet. Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted. There are a lot of bitches out there."
18738,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, bitches are the worst."
18739,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"All right, well I’ll see you later."
18740,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Uh, Penny, there’s something I have to tell you."
18741,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,What?
18742,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um, are you familiar with Darwin’s observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?"
18743,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,Did they make a movie about it?
18744,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,No.
18745,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,Then no.
18746,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else."
18747,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,Okay.
18748,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?
18749,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?"
18750,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Sure, that has birds in it."
18751,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"It’s fun talking to you, Leonard, I always learn stuff."
18752,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"I’m sorry, but I’m gonna count that."
18753,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,Do you really have to wear that in bed?
18754,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Yeah. The doctor didn’t want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.
18755,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,So did you get to talk to Penny?
18756,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Oh, yes. Indeed, I did."
18757,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,And?
18758,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.
18759,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,Was she upset?
18760,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Maybe, but that’s not my problem. She’s not my girlfriend, you are."
18761,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,I hope you weren’t cruel to her.
18762,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature’s way?"
18763,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?
18764,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,What?
18765,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"I think I figured out Wolowitz’s magic trick, and I need you to pick a card."
18766,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"I am not opening that door, Sheldon."
18767,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,As you wish.
18768,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"Pick a card, put it back, and prepare to be amazed."
18769,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,Did you pick one?
18770,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Yep.
18771,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,Is this your card?
18772,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Nope.
18773,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,Drat. Is this your card?
18774,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,No.
18775,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,I’ll be right back.
18776,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it, and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards. Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image, cross-referencing."
18777,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Whatcha doin’?
18778,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,I’m reverse engineering Wolowitz’s magic trick.
18779,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,What’s up with the infrared cameras?
18780,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"I’m measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one’s been touched. By the way, if you hope to have children, I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. Your testicles look a tad warm."
18781,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?"
18782,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,Yes. I’m using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.
18783,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Sheldon, that computer is used for National defence. Hacking into it is a Federal crime."
18784,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"Relax, we’re not under attack right now."
18785,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Okay, I’m leaving before the black helicopters get here."
18786,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"And is this my card? Rats! I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer. Where am I going to find Uranium-235 this time of night? Come on, Craigslist."
18787,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?
18788,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,"It’s okay, I like Indian food."
18789,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Or as you probably call it back home, food."
18790,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,Why didn’t you wear your contacts? Don’t you like them?
18791,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"No, no, I do. It’s just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time."
18792,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,"You know, my company offered me a position here in Los Angeles."
18793,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Does that mean you’d relocate here permanently?
18794,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,Maybe. What do you think?
18795,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Oh,  I love it. Oh, that’s great!"
18796,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,Hi! Hi! Just hang on.
18797,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Small world.
18798,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,"You did talk to her, didn’t you?"
18799,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked."
18800,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn’t look like a mannequin in the boys’ department. Hey, did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?"
18801,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,"No, he did not."
18802,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his Spiderman underwear. That’s our Lenny, huh?"
18803,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,"Yes, that’s our Lenny."
18804,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"So, how’s the food here? Oh, wow, that is really, really good. Oh, I’m sorry. You guys are on a date. We can hang out anytime. Have fun."
18805,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Bye.
18806,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Priya,Good night.
18807,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Oh, that’s, hot, hot, hot, hot! Whoo! It really sneaks up on ya, huh? All right, I gotta go."
18808,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,It is pretty spicy.
18809,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"Oh, I’ve been meaning to tell you, I figured out your magic trick."
18810,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,Really?
18811,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. In fact, I improved upon it."
18812,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"I’d love to see that. How about you, Raj?"
18813,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Raj,Beefaroni and a show? How do you turn that down?
18814,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,All right. Pick a card.
18815,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,Okay.
18816,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,Bippity-boppity-boo.
18817,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,What’s with the wand and the beep?
18818,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me, I’m getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaning’s ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da."
18819,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Raj,These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader. It’s transmitting to your phone.
18820,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"I said, ta-da. Show’s over."
18821,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"That’s pathetic. Let me show you how a real magician does it. Raj, take a card. Don’t let me see it."
18822,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Raj,Okay.
18823,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,Three of clubs.
18824,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Raj,"Son of a gun, you’re blowing my mind!"
18825,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!
18826,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,That does it. I’m getting uranium.
18827,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Raj,You ever gonna tell him?
18828,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,Maybe. When it stops being fun.
18829,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Raj,So never.
18830,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work."
18831,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Oh, okay, it’s not important. It can wait."
18832,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"No, it’s all right. Walk me down. So, what’s up?"
18833,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with."
18834,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Sure, anything."
18835,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Move out.
18836,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,What?
18837,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La Cañada has some great schools."
18838,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Okay, I’m not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all about?"
18839,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Why does it have to be about anything? Can’t a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?"
18840,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Oh, for god’s sake, Leonard, this is about Priya, isn’t it? She doesn’t want me hanging out with you."
18841,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Yes. There, I said it."
18842,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Okay, look, I happen to like your girlfriend."
18843,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,And she likes you.
18844,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"No, she doesn’t."
18845,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Not really, no."
18846,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"It doesn’t matter. Look, I promise from now on I will keep my distance from you."
18847,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment."
18848,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,You can hear my toilet flush?
18849,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"I don’t listen for it, but it’s nice to know everything’s okay with your plumbing. The building’s plumbing."
18850,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Leonard, I get it. You’re in a new relationship now. And I’m happy for you. So why don’t we just shake hands and part friends?"
18851,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?"
18852,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,Are you really that kind of guy?
18853,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.
18854,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Penny,"Good-bye, Leonard."
18855,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,"Penny, wait."
18856,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Leonard,Damned contacts.
18857,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,Incoming.
18858,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Raj,Hi!
18859,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,Hey!
18860,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,Hello.
18861,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Raj,"Why so glum, chum?"
18862,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"Apparently, you can’t hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother."
18863,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"Oh, that’s too bad. Figure out the magic trick yet?"
18864,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,Figure out the magic trick yet?
18865,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,Want me to tell you how to do it?
18866,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,No.
18867,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,I’ll show you one more time. Raj?
18868,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,"Hang on. This time do it with me, so I can make sure there’s no monkey business."
18869,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,All right.
18870,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,Two of hearts.
18871,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Sheldon,I hate you.
18872,4,18,the prestidigitation approximation,Howard,"Yeah, he’s gonna win the Nobel prize."
18873,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?"
18874,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Policeman,Here. Breathe into this bag.
18875,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,What’s going on?
18876,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"They stole everything, Leonard, everything."
18877,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Policeman,Are you the roommate?
18878,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?"
18879,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Policeman,Your friend here called 911 to report a robbery.
18880,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Oh, my God, what did they get?"
18881,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"What didn’t they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold."
18882,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?
18883,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus, the FBI hung up on me."
18884,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Policeman,Into the bag.
18885,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,They took my battle ostrich.
18886,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Oh, no, not Glenn?"
18887,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"Yes, Glenn! The only bird I ever loved."
18888,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Policeman,"Good luck, fellas."
18889,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Thank you, officer."
18890,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Wait a minute! You’re not going to do anything?
18891,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Policeman,"Mr. Cooper, there’s nothing…"
18892,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Doctor Cooper.
18893,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Policeman,Seriously?
18894,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,Not the kind with access to drugs.
18895,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Policeman,"Fine. Dr. Cooper. I’m sorry for your loss, but the Pasadena Police Department doesn’t have jurisdiction in Pandora."
18896,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"That’s from Avatar, World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?"
18897,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Policeman,What?
18898,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?"
18899,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Policeman,No.
18900,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Thank you, officer."
18901,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,It’s all gone. All gone.
18902,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"I’m really sorry, Sheldon."
18903,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man’s battle ostrich?"
18904,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,I don’t know.
18905,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
18906,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,I’m on it.
18907,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath."
18908,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,See if Raj is done with Pilates.
18909,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. It’s almost as if it was a huge waste of time."
18910,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"Whoever did this knew what they were doing. He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn’t leave a digital fingerprint."
18911,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Oh! There isn’t enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.
18912,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,"Hold on. I’m talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him, he’ll help us track down your things."
18913,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Can we trust him?
18914,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,"I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family."
18915,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,Whoa! Somebody’s auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!
18916,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"No. Glenn’s was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I haven’t given up hope."
18917,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,Hey.
18918,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Hey, Penny. We’re kind of in the middle of a crisis, here."
18919,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you."
18920,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"That game? Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing… all right, technically it’s a game."
18921,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,"Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud."
18922,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!"
18923,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.
18924,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,Just say thank you.
18925,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,I thought I just did.
18926,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,All right. See you later.
18927,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,Oh! Hello.
18928,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that’s useful in a make-believe place."
18929,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,I don’t know what that means.
18930,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"Yeah, well, sadly, I do."
18931,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading at the beach? Can you believe that?
18932,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Bernadette,"I feel like I’m supposed to say that bitch, but I don’t have enough information."
18933,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water."
18934,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Bernadette,I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.
18935,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,So what’s the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.
18936,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Amy,I think you’re on.
18937,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Bernadette,Oh. That bitch!
18938,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?
18939,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Amy,"Ah, here’s the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never going to happen. Yes, please."
18940,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"You guys should’ve seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes."
18941,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Amy,I’m drunk.
18942,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends."
18943,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Bernadette,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’m never speaking to Priya again."
18944,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"No, don’t do that. No reason to be mean to her."
18945,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Amy,"This may be the alcohol talking, but I believe there is. Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of Kyoto University?"
18946,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"No, but I can name all the Kardashians."
18947,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Amy,"Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. Bernadette’s urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA."
18948,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Bernadette,I don’t have an urge to fling my waste.
18949,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Amy,"Believe me, it’s there, we all have it. Hit me with some more booze, and I’ll show you."
18950,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"All right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down."
18951,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,I don’t think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone’s undressing her with their eyes.
18952,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.
18953,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Okay, what exactly are we looking for?"
18954,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly. According to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and it’s after school hours, he’s your guy."
18955,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,"Leonard, is this going to take much longer? I thought we were going to spend some time together."
18956,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Uh, we are. In the meantime, you’re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us."
18957,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,Seriously?
18958,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it’s fun."
18959,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,Maybe I should just go home.
18960,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,Our troll just walked in! I got him!
18961,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,We got him. We’re almost done.
18962,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"So, how do you guys want to play this?"
18963,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn’t start talking, we’ll register a complaint with his Internet service provider."
18964,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,"Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming."
18965,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"I don’t care! I’m losin’ it, man!"
18966,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Why don’t we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin."
18967,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,"Oh, dear Lord."
18968,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"Nah, I think we have to be more subtle."
18969,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,"Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, I’ll have sex with him."
18970,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,That’s not where it was going.
18971,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,"Good, because I would hate that."
18972,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,"Leonard, you’re busy, let’s talk tomorrow."
18973,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?"
18974,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,"No, no, I think it’s sexy to date a boy trapped in a man’s body."
18975,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Good, good. I’ll tell you what happens."
18976,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,And people think I don’t get sarcasm.
18977,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Amy,"Well, well, well. Look who it is."
18978,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"Okay, be nice."
18979,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,Hello.
18980,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,Hi. We’re just heading out for a drink.
18981,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Amy,Because I do that now.
18982,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Bernadette,Count your blessings you’re not a Tanzanian chimp.
18983,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,What?
18984,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"Don’t listen to her, she’s had a lot of ice cream. Do you want to join us?"
18985,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,"Oh, thank you, but I have work to do."
18986,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Amy,"Four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?"
18987,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?
18988,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,"Oh, no, don’t put me in the middle of this. I’m not going to be your go-between."
18989,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?"
18990,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,There’s no reason to worry.
18991,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,That’s a relief.
18992,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,I’m sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.
18993,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker."
18994,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,What?
18995,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,Really?
18996,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman."
18997,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"I’ve never said these words before, but good job, Howard!"
18998,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California."
18999,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,The name and the address drip with evil.
19000,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,What else do we know about him?
19001,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"Well, quite a bit, actually."
19002,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,I’ll bet he’s some loser who lives with his parents.
19003,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"Yes, he does live with his parents. Here’s a Google Earth shot of their house."
19004,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Excellent! It’s in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.
19005,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Hold on, you’re thinking of going there?"
19006,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.
19007,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?"
19008,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"I don’t know if you’ve been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture."
19009,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,No one’s getting tortured.
19010,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"Fine, we’ll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?"
19011,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,I totally had one of those.
19012,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who’s with me?"
19013,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,"I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?"
19014,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Sure.
19015,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"Also, tonight’s the Sabbath and my mother and I have a tradition of lighting the candles and watching Wheel of Fortune, so If we could leave at eight, we’d still be able to regain our birthright at ten, ten thirty latest."
19016,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Fine. Leonard?
19017,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Oh, geez, I don’t know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row."
19018,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,"Oh, come on, man. Bros before… my sister."
19019,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Aw, screw it. I’m in."
19020,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,"Me, too."
19021,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,And me.
19022,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,One moment.
19023,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"I’m hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold."
19024,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother."
19025,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"I am. She’s just bleaching her moustache. Check it out. Hey, Ma! Before and After! Four words, 17 letters, two N’s, one V."
19026,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard’s Mother,Fanny pack of wolves.
19027,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,That’s incredible.
19028,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"Yeah, she’s kind of a Wheel savant."
19029,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Uh-oh, that’s Priya."
19030,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,"Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude."
19031,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Hit the… Hey, sweetie. Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m gonna be working late. I, I, I miss you, too. Okay, sure, I’ll call you when I get home. Okay, bye-bye."
19032,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,Very nice. You lie to my sister.
19033,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,That’s the nicest thing he does to your sister.
19034,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,"Oh, guess who."
19035,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,Cover for me.
19036,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,"Hello, Priya. What’s up? How would I know if Leonard’s at work or not? Don’t be suspicious. Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue, you’re going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. You owe me."
19037,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"New puzzle, Ma. Same name. One N, two D’s, three O’s."
19038,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard’s Mother,Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!
19039,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,That’s uncanny.
19040,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"I know. It’s her superpower. Well, that and jiggling her arm fat."
19041,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,I can’t believe we’re going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.
19042,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"Yeah, we’re kind of bad-asses, aren’t we?"
19043,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,Totally.
19044,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,"Hey, how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?"
19045,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"Sea World is better. It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun. But for the moment, let’s stay focused on Todd Zarnecki."
19046,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,"Yeah, we’re coming for you, Todd Zarnecki. And for the record, Legoland is more interactive."
19047,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"I almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there, lead foot. You trying to get us killed?"
19048,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.
19049,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.
19050,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,It’s a re-writable CD. Just put it in.
19051,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,Beyonce? Really?
19052,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,She’s curvy and she owns it. I like that.
19053,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Oh, yeah, I’m feeling it."
19054,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.
19055,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"Next time we go to kick someone’s ass, we take the train."
19056,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,I always prefer the train.
19057,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Sheldon, let’s go."
19058,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Coming.
19059,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,Why did you bring that?
19060,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,No weapon strikes more fear into a man’s heart than a Klingon bat’leth.
19061,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Okay, let’s get clear on something. We’re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one’s bat’lething anybody."
19062,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?
19063,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,No.
19064,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"Well, now I just feel silly holding it."
19065,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,Come on.
19066,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Can I at least kick down the door?
19067,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"You’re welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box."
19068,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Voice Inside,Who is it?
19069,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Your doom!
19070,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,Don’t say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?
19071,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Good point. Basket of puppies.
19072,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Huge man,What?
19073,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Uh, Sheldon?"
19074,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Are you Todd Zarnecki?
19075,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Todd,Yeah. Who are you?
19076,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.
19077,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Todd,I don’t think so. Let me see that.
19078,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Careful. That’s a collectible.
19079,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Todd,I know. I’ve always wanted one.
19080,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"Well, he’s even more cunning than we thought."
19081,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"You know, the joke’s on him. Without the certificate of authenticity, that bat’leth is worthless."
19082,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"Yeah, he walked right into our trap."
19083,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.
19084,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,Oh-oh.
19085,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,What’s the matter?
19086,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Something’s wrong, I’m not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?"
19087,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Of course.
19088,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Raj,Very basic.
19089,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,19th-century technology.
19090,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?
19091,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,No.
19092,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"No, not a clue."
19093,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Well, we’d better call somebody to come pick us up."
19094,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,It’d be swell if they had a train.
19095,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"Thank you, Penny."
19096,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"No problem. So, Leonard, I think it’s interesting you didn’t call your girlfriend to come get you."
19097,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Uh, I kind of told her I was working."
19098,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,So you lied to her. Also interesting.
19099,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,"Yeah, she doesn’t really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing."
19100,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"Well, doesn’t matter if she gets it, as long as she’s pretty."
19101,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Howard,"This one’s funny, Leonard. How come you couldn’t make it work with her?"
19102,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,So did you at least get Sheldon’s fake stuff back?
19103,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,No. We failed in our noble quest.
19104,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,How come?
19105,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,Todd Zarnecki was mean.
19106,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,All right. Hang on.
19107,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Leonard,What are you doing?
19108,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,I’m gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska. Oh. Beyonce.
19109,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,This ain’t no Beyonce.
19110,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Todd,Now what?
19111,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,Give my friend his stuff back.
19112,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Todd,I don’t know what you’re talking about.
19113,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"Well, then, good news. Today’s the day a girl’s finally going to touch you in your little special place."
19114,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,Now give him his stuff back.
19115,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Todd,Okay.
19116,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Sheldon,"We did it! I said, we."
19117,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,"Oh, hold the door."
19118,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"Oh, hi."
19119,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,Hi.
19120,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,Going to see Leonard?
19121,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,Yes. How have you been?
19122,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,Fine. You?
19123,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,"Very well, thank you."
19124,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,"Alright, well great seeing you."
19125,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Priya,"Yeah, you too."
19126,4,19,the zarnecki incursion,Penny,Amy’s right. I do want to fling my poop at her.
19127,4,20,the herb garden germination,Dr. Brian Greene,"My new book, The Hidden Reality, takes on a grand question. Is our universe the only universe? You see, there’s a growing belief among scientists like me that ours may only be one among many universes populating a gigantic cosmos. In The Hidden Reality, I explore this possibility without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics on the part of the reader."
19128,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Hysterical.
19129,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,"I’m glad you talked me into this. We work so hard, sometimes, it’s nice to goof off and do something silly."
19130,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe you’re in a comedy club.
19131,4,20,the herb garden germination,Greene,"You can think about Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle much like the special order menu that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have dishes in column A and other dishes in column B, and if you order the first dish in column A, you can’t order the corresponding dish in column B. That’s sort of like the Uncertainly Principle."
19132,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Ba-dum-bump.
19133,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,"Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette."
19134,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"Really, Amy? Gossip? I’m disappointed in you."
19135,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,"Now, now. Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups."
19136,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"Forgive my language, but poppycock."
19137,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,"What if he’s right? And by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?"
19138,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene, what’s the 4-1-1?"
19139,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
19140,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"I believe our nation’s tuna cans are safe. Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?"
19141,4,20,the herb garden germination,Greene,Yes?
19142,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,You’ve dedicated your life’s work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.
19143,4,20,the herb garden germination,Greene,"Yes, in part."
19144,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps, reading to the elderly?"
19145,4,20,the herb garden germination,Greene,Excuse me?
19146,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"Yeah, but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid, of course. Big fan."
19147,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Nice shot.
19148,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Thank you. My father taught me archery as a child. It’s odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.
19149,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Perfect.
19150,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"I know. What an elf I would have made. Whoo, what do you think you’re doing?"
19151,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Shooting at a target?
19152,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,With what?
19153,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,An arrow.
19154,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Really? I didn’t see you draw one from your quiver.
19155,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"I’m not going to do that, Sheldon."
19156,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. We have to do our part, too."
19157,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"That was uncalled for, but I’ll play along. Ow! I had an unusual experience with Amy last night."
19158,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Really? How could you tell?
19159,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,She was attempting to engage me in gossip.
19160,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,You don’t say?
19161,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.
19162,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"So, what’s the gossip?"
19163,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"Oh, please, I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity."
19164,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Fine, don’t tell me."
19165,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"All right, get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard."
19166,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Oh. That’s too bad. I wonder what happened.
19167,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"Mm, it’s hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents’ marriage implode. In that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows."
19168,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Boy, you sure get your money’s worth out of these games."
19169,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Priya, can I come in?"
19170,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,Sure.
19171,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Oh, God."
19172,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,What?
19173,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,It’s okay. You didn’t know. I’ll take care of it.
19174,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,"What, what did I do?"
19175,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Sheldon doesn’t allow flossing that close to the mirror.
19176,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,You’re kidding.
19177,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,It’s a splatter thing. There’s a little piece of tape on the floor you’re supposed to stand behind.
19178,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,That’s madness.
19179,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"I know. Just do it. There’s a big inspection coming up, and I don’t want to lose my TV privileges."
19180,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,You really need to let me take a look at that roommate agreement one of these days.
19181,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Mm, I don’t know. I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, it’s just easier to stand behind the tape."
19182,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,"Oh, by the way, a fellow at work said I could use his Dodger tickets this weekend. Does that sound like fun?"
19183,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Yeah! Dodgers are baseball, right?"
19184,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,You’ll need to explain the game to me.
19185,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Mm, it’s complicated, but as I remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home."
19186,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,"Well, regardless, I’ve got four tickets, and I was thinking we can bring Bernadette and Howard. She’s really interesting, and I bet I can get used to him."
19187,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two."
19188,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,Why not?
19189,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Don’t tell anybody I told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him."
19190,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,"Oh, too bad. Although I do know one person for whom that’s good news."
19191,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Really? Who?
19192,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,My brother. He’s got a big crush on Bernadette.
19193,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,What? You’re kidding!
19194,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,"Mmm. I found poems he wrote about her. Very disturbing. Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet."
19195,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Wow, that’s hard to believe."
19196,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,"Yes. And for years, everyone in my family was convinced that he was the clarinet enthusiast. Hmm. What’s that piece of tape?"
19197,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Oh, that one doesn’t apply to you. You sit."
19198,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Hey!
19199,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,Hey! How’s it going?
19200,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?
19201,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,‘Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?
19202,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.
19203,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,"Oh, damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence. Boy, some people are such blabbermouths. Well, whatever, I’m sure Bernadette can do better."
19204,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?
19205,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?
19206,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,I didn’t say Raj. Who said Raj?
19207,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,"Okay, give. How do you know? Did he tell you?"
19208,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,No.
19209,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,"Well, then who?"
19210,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,I can’t say.
19211,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,"Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion."
19212,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Well, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Raj’s friendship."
19213,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,"You don’t have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret."
19214,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,You’re the one who told Amy in the first place.
19215,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,In confidence!
19216,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,"Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy. How are you?"
19217,4,20,the herb garden germination,Mrs Koothrappali,"We’re very rich in a very poor country. So, all in all, can’t complain."
19218,4,20,the herb garden germination,Dr Koothrappali,"So, Priya, how are enjoying staying with your brother?"
19219,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,"It’s fine. But if I’m going to stay in Los Angeles much longer, I think I should get my own place."
19220,4,20,the herb garden germination,Mrs Koothrappali,"Why? Is Rajesh not making you feel comfortable? Rajesh, why aren’t you making your sister comfortable?"
19221,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,"I am making her comfortable. Besides, she’s not sleeping here half the time anyway."
19222,4,20,the herb garden germination,Dr Koothrappali,"What? Where are you sleeping, Priya?"
19223,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,"It’s a figure of speech, Daddy. It means I-I work late."
19224,4,20,the herb garden germination,Mrs Koothrappali,"Please tell me you’re not dating an American. I knew this would happen. Rajesh, are you letting your sister date that little Howard boy?"
19225,4,20,the herb garden germination,Dr Koothrappali,"Now, hold on. If she is dating an American, that’s not a bad way to go. He’s Jewish. Those chaps are very successful, and they don’t drink a lot."
19226,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,"It, it doesn’t matter. Howard has a girlfriend."
19227,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,For now.
19228,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,What does that mean?
19229,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,I’ll tell you later.
19230,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,Is something going on with him and Bernadette?
19231,4,20,the herb garden germination,Mrs Koothrappali,Who’s Bernadette?
19232,4,20,the herb garden germination,Dr Koothrappali,Doesn’t sound Jewish.
19233,4,20,the herb garden germination,Mrs Koothrappali,You can’t tell by that. Winona Ryder is Jewish.
19234,4,20,the herb garden germination,Dr Koothrappali,"Okay, we’re getting off the subject. Rajesh, I want you to try harder to make your sister feel welcome."
19235,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,"Thank you, Daddy."
19236,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,"Don’t worry. Everything I have, I share with her. Including my friend Leon…"
19237,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,"Good night, Mummy. Good night, Daddy."
19238,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,"Oh, my God, I think you broke my toe!"
19239,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,Well you should have kept your mouth shut.
19240,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,"Fair enough. Now, what’s up with Clarinet? Bernadette!"
19241,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,I’ve been thinking about Dr. Greene’s efforts to make science palatable for the masses.
19242,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Oh, yeah? What about it?"
19243,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"That’s all. I’ve just been thinking about it. Now, I’m thinking about fractal equations. Now I’m thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. Now I’m thinking about trains."
19244,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,Are you listening to this guy?
19245,4,20,the herb garden germination,Howard,"Hmm? Oh, I’m sorry. I was somewhere else."
19246,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Lucky bastard.
19247,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Now I’m thinking about Jell-O.
19248,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,So what’s up?
19249,4,20,the herb garden germination,Howard,It’s a Bernadette thing.
19250,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,"Oh, no. I hope everything’s okay."
19251,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Whatever it is, we’re here for you. You can tell us anything."
19252,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,Yeah. Good or devastating.
19253,4,20,the herb garden germination,Howard,I’m gonna ask her to marry me.
19254,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Marry you?
19255,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,What?
19256,4,20,the herb garden germination,Howard,Yeah. I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.
19257,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Oh, I’d wait."
19258,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,"No rush, no rush."
19259,4,20,the herb garden germination,Howard,"Oh, great. It’s my cousin David about the ring. Hey, David, what’d you find? Oh, sure, a half a carat’s fine. Her freakishly small hands make anything look big. It’s one of the reasons I love her."
19260,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Man, he’s going to be blindsided."
19261,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,I know. It’ll be awful.
19262,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Why are you smiling?
19263,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Yeah, Raj, why?"
19264,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,"Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. India’s a goofy place."
19265,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m back to trains. Woo-woo."
19266,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?
19267,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,No.
19268,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,Fascinating work. I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.
19269,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Have you learned anything?
19270,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. Although it’s not much of a contest. The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.
19271,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"If you don’t mind, I’d like to stop listening to you and start talking."
19272,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,By all means.
19273,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.
19274,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,I don’t understand. The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.
19275,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly, no one tweeted."
19276,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,It’s not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. Are you familiar with meme theory?
19277,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"I’m familiar with everything, but go on."
19278,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,Meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.
19279,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"I’m no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School, the phrase Shelly Cooper’s a smelly pooper spread like wildfire."
19280,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,I should think so. That’s gold.
19281,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?
19282,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?
19283,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,It’s one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don’t find repellent.
19284,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.
19285,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.
19286,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,"Then we’ll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology."
19287,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. You’re a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler."
19288,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,"Oh, hey, Amy. What’s up?"
19289,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,"Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse. In other news, I’m thinking of starting an herb garden. Mum’s the word. Gotta go."
19290,4,20,the herb garden germination,Bernadette,"Oh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?"
19291,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,"I just felt like drinking alone, because I’m deep and dark."
19292,4,20,the herb garden germination,Bernadette,"Uh-huh. So, uh, Howard’s not here?"
19293,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,No. It’s just one of those times when it’s just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?
19294,4,20,the herb garden germination,Bernadette,Yeah.
19295,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,"Me, too. Good times."
19296,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,"Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers."
19297,4,20,the herb garden germination,Bernadette,"Oh, thanks."
19298,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,This was nice.
19299,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,"What the hell are you doing? Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend. You should be ashamed of yourself."
19300,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,"I was when I came in, but it’s amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is, Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard."
19301,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,"Well, I know that. How do you know that?"
19302,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,My sister told me.
19303,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,"Oh, that gossipy bitch! No offense."
19304,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.
19305,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,"Okay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around."
19306,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,What can I do? I can’t stop thinking about her.
19307,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,"All right, try thinking about this. Sheldon and Amy had sex."
19308,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,Shut your ass!
19309,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,"Yeah, it’s true. Amy told me."
19310,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,How did that even happen? Did they know that’s what they were doing when they were doing it?
19311,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.
19312,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,Wow. I can’t believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.
19313,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Hey.
19314,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Hey.
19315,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Hope you’re hungry.
19316,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the Sudan. It’s a lesson in context."
19317,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Will Amy be joining us for dinner?
19318,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"Yes, I believe so."
19319,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Good, good. Everything okay between you two?"
19320,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Yes. Why do you ask?
19321,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days."
19322,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"Did he mean as if she’d been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?"
19323,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,No. That’s not what he meant.
19324,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"Well, we may never know. As my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do."
19325,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Yeah, you do. You dog, you."
19326,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Did you get that?
19327,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,Every word. Our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.
19328,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,This is moving faster than we thought.
19329,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,Agreed. It appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.
19330,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction."
19331,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,"Slow down, Sheldon. I’m not quite there yet."
19332,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Pass the soy sauce.
19333,4,20,the herb garden germination,Howard,Sure.
19334,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.
19335,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Pun intended?
19336,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,No. Happy accident.
19337,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,This is remarkable. Took less than 24 hours.
19338,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.
19339,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"Interesting. So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were."
19340,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,Pun intended?
19341,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,I’m sorry. What pun?
19342,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,"Not important. I described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective."
19343,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,"I wish you hadn’t done that. That’s going to make me a chick magnet, and I’m so busy as it is."
19344,4,20,the herb garden germination,Howard,"Hey, everybody, I got something I want to ask Bernadette, and I can’t think of a better time than when I’m with all my friends."
19345,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,"Oh, hold on, Howard. There’s lots of better times."
19346,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,"Leonard, please. The man is talking. Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may."
19347,4,20,the herb garden germination,Howard,Thank you. Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski…
19348,4,20,the herb garden germination,Bernadette,"Oh, God. What’s happening?"
19349,4,20,the herb garden germination,Howard,"I know things haven’t been perfect with us, and we’ve had our problems, but I just have to tell you, from the moment I…"
19350,4,20,the herb garden germination,Bernadette,"Howard, let me just stop you right here."
19351,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,This is it.
19352,4,20,the herb garden germination,Bernadette,Yes.
19353,4,20,the herb garden germination,Howard,"Yes, what?"
19354,4,20,the herb garden germination,Bernadette,"Yes, I will marry you."
19355,4,20,the herb garden germination,Howard,You will?
19356,4,20,the herb garden germination,Raj,You will?
19357,4,20,the herb garden germination,Bernadette,I will. I will!
19358,4,20,the herb garden germination,Howard,"Oh, I love you so much."
19359,4,20,the herb garden germination,Bernadette,"Oh, I love you, too."
19360,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,Congratulations!
19361,4,20,the herb garden germination,Priya,"Oh, it’s so exciting."
19362,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,I wonder what changed her mind.
19363,4,20,the herb garden germination,Sheldon,Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.
19364,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,As good an explanation as any.
19365,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,That’s great.
19366,4,20,the herb garden germination,Penny,"Oh, hey, Amy. Bernadette just texted me. Howard proposed?"
19367,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,"Yes, not important. Just stopped by to let you know I’m getting orthotics. Also, I’m carrying Sheldon’s baby. Mum’s the word."
19368,4,20,the herb garden germination,Leonard,You’re pregnant?
19369,4,20,the herb garden germination,Amy,Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?
19370,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Leonard, are you in the shower?"
19371,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,"I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower."
19372,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"I asked if you were in the shower, but that’s moot now."
19373,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,What?
19374,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.
19375,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,"I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower."
19376,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.
19377,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,What kind of emergency?
19378,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder."
19379,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,You might not want to do that.
19380,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,I assure you I do.
19381,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m not alone in here."
19382,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,What?
19383,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"Hello, Sheldon."
19384,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,What are you doing in there? She can’t be in here.
19385,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,"We were in here first, you can’t be in here."
19386,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force."
19387,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Come on, you can’t wait two minutes?"
19388,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"Oh, Leonard, let the man pee."
19389,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Penny? Penny? Penny?
19390,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,What?
19391,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Move. Move. Move!
19392,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive reading of the charges?"
19393,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,"Yeah, fine."
19394,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"Hang on. No, my client does not waive reading of the charges."
19395,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,Oh. Cool. I’ve got a lawyer. And I’ve seen her naked.
19396,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,Proceed.
19397,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Very well. Count the first, on or about the 28th day of April, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. Count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens."
19398,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,Can I see the roommate agreement?
19399,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Um, it’s fairly technical."
19400,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,I think I can handle it.
19401,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,"Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face."
19402,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"All right, based on a cursory reading, it doesn’t look like you have much of a case, Sheldon."
19403,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Do so, do so."
19404,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"Oh, I’m afraid not. Section seven here, on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situations, is not specific as to what constitutes an emergency."
19405,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Oh, that’s ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory."
19406,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair, could he barge in while you were showering?"
19407,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Irrelevant. Leonard doesn’t trim his nose hair. He thinks because he’s short nobody can see up there.
19408,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it, in this case, Leonard. So much for count one."
19409,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,But…
19410,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"There’s no buts, Sheldon, that’s how the law works."
19411,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,Schooled!
19412,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"As for the shower capacity issue, I cite addendum J. When Sheldon showers second, any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water. I believe this supercedes the occupancy issue."
19413,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,Superceded!
19414,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,This isn’t over.
19415,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,"No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that’s happened today."
19416,4,21,the agreement dissection,Raj,"Mmm, Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing we’ve done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail."
19417,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,Seriously?
19418,4,21,the agreement dissection,Howard,I wish to discuss your theories of black holes. Meet me at the Randy’s Donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.
19419,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,What is that you’re eating? Tonight is pizza night.
19420,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,I’d like to refer that to my attorney.
19421,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"According to what I see here, Thursday nights are Franconi’s pizza night."
19422,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Yes, and when Franconi’s went out of business, we switched to Graziano’s."
19423,4,21,the agreement dissection,Howard,"That’s interesting. Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?"
19424,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"A good question, Howard. Turns out you can’t. According to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period. Were those criteria met?"
19425,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,No.
19426,4,21,the agreement dissection,All,Opa!
19427,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food."
19428,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,Not as much as you.
19429,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Fine. I’m nothing if not adaptable.
19430,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,I got you the lamb kabob.
19431,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isn’t that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat."
19432,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Penny? Penny? Penny?
19433,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,Hey. What’s up?
19434,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment. Order one.
19435,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,"Oh, I’m sorry, honey, I’m meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you’re welcome to tag along."
19436,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"A girls night? Oh, I don’t know if I’m up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps."
19437,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,"Okay, suit yourself. We’ll probably be trashing Priya a little."
19438,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Shotgun.
19439,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,"Okay, I’d like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out."
19440,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,"Fair warning, we can get ker-razy."
19441,4,21,the agreement dissection,Bernadette,Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.
19442,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?"
19443,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,Why did you bring him? He’s harshing my buzz.
19444,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,I felt sorry for him. Priya’s giving him a hard time.
19445,4,21,the agreement dissection,Bernadette,"Ooh, the Priya bashing’s starting early. Yay! Okay, what’s up with those pantsuits?"
19446,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,I need some context.
19447,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,Pantsuits suck.
19448,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,"And that opens her up To justifiable ridicule for wearing them. Good one, Bernadette. See? Ker-razy."
19449,4,21,the agreement dissection,Bernadette,Whee-ee-ee!
19450,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,You smell like baby powder.
19451,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"It’s talc. But as that’s a primary ingredient of baby powder, I understand your confusion."
19452,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,"Oh, I’m not confused at all. You’re like a sexy toddler."
19453,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,I don’t know how to process that.
19454,4,21,the agreement dissection,Bernadette,I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.
19455,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,That’s too many S’s for kissing.
19456,4,21,the agreement dissection,Bernadette,Not if they’re doing it for a long time.
19457,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,"Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?"
19458,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. But in the interest of full disclosure, I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas card from her, signed with far too many X’s and O’s."
19459,4,21,the agreement dissection,Bernadette,That doesn’t count. Aren’t you even a little curious?
19460,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,"Yeah, you’re a scientist, where is the curiosity?"
19461,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,I’m available for experimentation.
19462,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.
19463,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,"Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie."
19464,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,I’m certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.
19465,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,"Hey, I know, let’s take Sheldon dancing."
19466,4,21,the agreement dissection,Bernadette,"Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate."
19467,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"No, thank you, but for the record, I’m an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha."
19468,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,Really?
19469,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,I don’t see why that’s surprising. I excel at so many things. You’ve had my sourdough bread.
19470,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,Did you take dance lessons?
19471,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Against my will. In the South, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna."
19472,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,"Oh, we are so taking you dancing."
19473,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"No, you most certainly are not."
19474,4,21,the agreement dissection,Bernadette,"Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?"
19475,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,I saved a nun’s life. Why am I being punished?
19476,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,Take us to a place we can waltz.
19477,4,21,the agreement dissection,Taxi driver,Where you can what?
19478,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Waltz. It’s a social dance from Austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature."
19479,4,21,the agreement dissection,Taxi Driver,Here we go.
19480,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,"I kissed a girl and I liked it, I hope my boyfriend don’t mind it."
19481,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,What happened to you?
19482,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,"Shake it baby, shake it!"
19483,4,21,the agreement dissection,Bernadette,"Muy caliente, Sheldon!"
19484,4,21,the agreement dissection,Elderly Korean Gentleman,Care to dance?
19485,4,21,the agreement dissection,Bernadette,"Oh, I’m sorry, I’m engaged."
19486,4,21,the agreement dissection,Korean,How about you?
19487,4,21,the agreement dissection,Penny,"Oh, what the hell. Ooh!"
19488,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,"How come if we’re the smart people, we don’t do this every night?"
19489,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,What’s 16 times 14?
19490,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,My burps taste like cranberry juice.
19491,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,And there’s your answer.
19492,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,Would you like to come in for a nightcap?
19493,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"If you’re referring to the beverage, you know I don’t drink. If you’re referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one."
19494,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,I have yoo-hoo.
19495,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,It’s hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.
19496,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,Make yourself comfortable.
19497,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Thank you. Is someone smoking?
19498,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,"Oh, that’s just Ricky."
19499,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,You own a smoking monkey?
19500,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,Don’t be silly. He’s one of the animals in my department’s nicotine addiction study.
19501,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,What’s he doing here?
19502,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,I’m giving him emphysema. The least I can do is let him hang out and watch cable.
19503,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Remarkable. Aren’t you worried about secondhand smoke?
19504,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while I’m sleeping.
19505,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?
19506,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,Yeah. He’s kind of an ass.
19507,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Thank you. May I share something with you that’s troubling me?
19508,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,Of course. What’s rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?
19509,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me."
19510,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,And you want me to kill her? Done.
19511,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"No, of course not."
19512,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us ’cause people love monkeys.
19513,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart Amy now."
19514,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?
19515,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,No.
19516,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?
19517,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. That’s a little outside my comfort zone."
19518,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,"You’re being too literal. My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you."
19519,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Are you suggesting I play dirty?
19520,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,"Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business."
19521,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Fascinating.
19522,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,I hope you don’t take what I’m about to do as a comment on what we just did.
19523,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Who’s to say you shouldn’t be dissecting our brains? You really are an ass.
19524,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,"Morning, Sheldon."
19525,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Oh, good, you’re up. I’ve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I’d like you to sign it."
19526,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,Why would I want to do that?
19527,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?"
19528,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,"Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?"
19529,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Affirmative. Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B."
19530,4,21,the agreement dissection,Female Voice,Self-destruct sequence activated.
19531,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,"What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?"
19532,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here."
19533,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,So what happens when it counts down?
19534,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that you’re in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter."
19535,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"Oh, my God."
19536,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,What’s the big deal?
19537,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"Trust me, it’s a big deal."
19538,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,"They’re gonna find out about me eventually, right?"
19539,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"Yeah, of course, just not today."
19540,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,20 seconds.
19541,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,Are you ashamed of me?
19542,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,Of course not.
19543,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,Then why can’t we tell your parents?
19544,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"Please, don’t push this."
19545,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"He does that all the time, doesn’t he? 15."
19546,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,"Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win. Turn it off."
19547,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,"No, he’s bluffing."
19548,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,I never bluff. Ten.
19549,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,It’s blackmail!
19550,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Nine.
19551,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,We give up.
19552,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Eight.
19553,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,This is ridiculous.
19554,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"It’s a laptop with a full charge. Honestly, what do you see in him?"
19555,4,21,the agreement dissection,Priya,Give him what he wants or we’re done.
19556,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Three.
19557,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,Really?
19558,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,Two.
19559,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,"Okay, I’ll sign it!"
19560,4,21,the agreement dissection,Female Voice,Self-destruct sequence aborted.
19561,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"You may have gone to Cambridge, but I’m an honorary graduate of Starfleet academy."
19562,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Good morning, Amy."
19563,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,It most assuredly is not.
19564,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and shame?"
19565,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,Yes. I also found a Korean man’s business card tucked into my cleavage. What happened last night?
19566,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"Ah, memory impairment, the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle."
19567,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,Sheldon?
19568,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"All right. Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home, you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes, following which you passed out on your bathroom floor. I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow, set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy, and I left."
19569,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,Okay. Don’t really know where we go from here.
19570,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,I suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked.
19571,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,Terrific. Thank you.
19572,4,21,the agreement dissection,Amy,They were out of menthols! Get off my back! Not easy living with a temperamental little primate.
19573,4,21,the agreement dissection,Leonard,"Come on, Priya, just admit I embarrass you!"
19574,4,21,the agreement dissection,Sheldon,"You’re preaching to the choir, sister."
19575,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"I must say, Penny, this is great fun."
19576,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,Glad you’re enjoying yourself.
19577,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a delightful social aspect."
19578,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,"Amy, you must’ve been in the bathroom with other women before."
19579,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.
19580,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,Some women don’t like to get chummy when their panties are down.
19581,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"You okay in there, bestie?"
19582,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,I’m fine.
19583,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine"
19584,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,"Yeah, I said I’m fine. Stop talking to me."
19585,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,She always this crabby when she urinates?
19586,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,We’re really not that close.
19587,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,Screw it. I’ll go later.
19588,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,And I’ll be right by your side.
19589,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?
19590,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,"Oh, that’s nice."
19591,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"No, it’s not. It’s a strategic manoeuvre. Leonard’s new girlfriend is testing Bernadette’s loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty."
19592,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,You think?
19593,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.
19594,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,"Well, what makes me the weakest member?"
19595,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn’t last a minute on the Serengeti.
19596,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,"Okay, Amy, you’re being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don’t have a problem with Leonard’s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I’ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple."
19597,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,It doesn’t matter. I’m going to tell her we can’t make it.
19598,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"Oh, no. You have to go."
19599,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,I don’t understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.
19600,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And we’re going to use that to our advantage."
19601,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,Wait. What are you talking about?
19602,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priya’s tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonard’s no stranger to back-alley cockfights."
19603,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,I don’t know. I’m not a very good liar. They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.
19604,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,Don’t worry. I’ll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.
19605,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,"Okay, I don’t know you people. I’m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card."
19606,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?
19607,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,I don’t want anything in my ample bosom.
19608,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team."
19609,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,"Okay, see you later."
19610,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.
19611,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,That is good news. Bye.
19612,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation."
19613,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,"That, that’s brilliant."
19614,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"It’s what I do. But wait, there’s more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman."
19615,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,"Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?"
19616,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"When the serpent slithers to an opposing player’s piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh."
19617,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,All right.
19618,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent."
19619,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,Elegant.
19620,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,That’s because it’s simple.
19621,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,"Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you."
19622,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,And…
19623,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,And what?
19624,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"And a third person. It’s three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that."
19625,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,"Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life."
19626,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn’t been such a hound dog, we’d all have time machines."
19627,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,Got it. Bye.
19628,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,You know I’m right.
19629,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,I think he’s getting worse.
19630,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"Oh, my metatarsal are barking."
19631,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,You okay?
19632,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"Yeah, yeah. I’m just breaking in some new shoes."
19633,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,Very pretty.
19634,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?
19635,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,Hadn’t really thought about it.
19636,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,Look.
19637,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,"Uh, sure. Very… prominent."
19638,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"Please, Leonard, don’t leer, you have a girlfriend."
19639,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,Sorry.
19640,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?"
19641,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,Yeah. How did you know?
19642,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, ’cause, you know, that’s kind of my life now. Have a good night. Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away."
19643,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Priya,"Hey, you."
19644,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,"Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?"
19645,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I’d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.
19646,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Priya,"Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?"
19647,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,I have to feel sorry for myself. I’m the only one who cares. Just like I’m the only one who’ll have sex with me.
19648,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,Really? In front of your sister?
19649,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Priya,We shared a room growing up. This is not news to me.
19650,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"Excuse me. I’m going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart."
19651,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,I forgot my windbreaker. It’s chilly.
19652,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,I don’t understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?
19653,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,"No. Once these puppies touch the ground they’re mine, and I’ll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty."
19654,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,Good news the wildebeest is in the curry.
19655,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,The what?
19656,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation “Priya Wouldn’t Wanna Be-ya.”
19657,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,Hey. Seriously? Didn’t you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
19658,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn’t have any.
19659,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,None?
19660,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It’s the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.
19661,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,Wh… What the hell did she say?
19662,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"She thinks it’s cool you’re following your dream, no matter what."
19663,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,That bitch!
19664,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,How do you want to handle it?
19665,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,"Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I’m on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie."
19666,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?
19667,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,What? I don’t know. It doesn’t matter.
19668,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,I’m gonna say 3-D. That’ll let her know the studio has faith in it.
19669,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Scene,Raj’s apartment.
19670,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,You’re kidding. 3-D?
19671,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,That’s what I hear.
19672,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Howard,Then the studio must have real faith in it.
19673,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,Wonder why she didn’t tell me.
19674,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Priya,Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?
19675,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,No.
19676,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Priya,Then why are you surprised she didn’t tell you?
19677,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,"Well, it’s not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing."
19678,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Priya,What other thing?
19679,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,"Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don’t, oh, what’s the word I’m looking for?"
19680,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Howard,I’m not going to help you. This is hilarious.
19681,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,She’s also dating an astronaut.
19682,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Priya,Wow. That’s very impressive.
19683,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,"Yeah. But Leonard’s impressive, too."
19684,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.
19685,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you.
19686,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,Will the two of you excuse me?
19687,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,I need a hug.
19688,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"Sorry, I have company."
19689,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"Come on, Sheldon, open the door."
19690,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,I don’t want to hug you.
19691,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"I don’t want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue."
19692,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"Blue, as in depressed."
19693,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"Well, not so much depressed as lonely."
19694,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,I don’t know what colour lonely is.
19695,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,What?
19696,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely."
19697,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,Nothing rhymes with orange. It’s probably lonely.
19698,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I don’t see that catching on at all."
19699,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,What are you doing?
19700,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,I’m working on my three-person chess game.
19701,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"Oh, cool. Can I play?"
19702,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,It’s three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?
19703,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,No.
19704,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can’t play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need."
19705,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"No, thank you. I’m fine."
19706,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,It’s not optional. We’re out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.
19707,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"I, uh, I guess you’re probably wondering what’s got me down."
19708,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the king’s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?"
19709,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"I’m going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I’m such a basket case, I can’t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body."
19710,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there’s a one-in-five chance he’ll kill himself."
19711,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I’m scared."
19712,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,Yellow. Go ahead.
19713,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they’re testing. He says it’s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
19714,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,Fascinating. What’s in it?
19715,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,I’m not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
19716,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,I like cows.
19717,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,That’s not the point.
19718,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,It was its own point. Go on.
19719,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"I’m a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I’m afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field."
19720,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"Rajesh, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs."
19721,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Howard,"Okay, I’m still trying to work this out. How did Penny meet an astronaut?"
19722,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,I don’t know. The regular way people meet astronauts.
19723,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Howard,Most of those guys live in Texas.
19724,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,"Obviously, this one doesn’t."
19725,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Howard,Okay.
19726,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,"Leonard lives here. Priya’s from India. People meet, Howard. God!"
19727,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Howard,Fine.
19728,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,"You’ve met lots of astronauts, and I’ve never grilled you about that. I’d thank you to extend me the same courtesy."
19729,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Howard,"I’m not grilling you, I was just curious."
19730,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,"I still can’t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend’s up to, ’cause I don’t."
19731,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,"Maybe that’s where she met the astronaut, all right?"
19732,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Priya,I’m sorry. What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?
19733,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,He’s a consultant.
19734,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?
19735,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,"He can’t have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?"
19736,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Howard,"It’s nice to have another couple to hang with, isn’t it?"
19737,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,nan
19738,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,"All right, guys, you have to go back. I can’t afford you. “No, don’t send us away, we love you.” I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent. “But, Penny, you look so good in us.” Damn it, the shoes are right."
19739,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless."
19740,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"What do you got for me, wildebeest?"
19741,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,I think they’re on to me. The story’s starting to fall apart.
19742,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,Calm down. Everything’s going to be okay.
19743,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"We may have to kill her. Bernadette, I’m putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?"
19744,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,In the bathroom.
19745,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,"Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. What’s the problem?"
19746,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,They’re just asking me all sorts of questions I can’t answer.
19747,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,Just change the subject.
19748,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya’s parents.
19749,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,What?
19750,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,They said something about going there this summer.
19751,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,"What, are they getting engaged?"
19752,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,I don’t know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy’s stupid astronaut story!
19753,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,What astronaut story?
19754,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,You texted me Penny’s dating an astronaut.
19755,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,I texted architect. That’s amusing. Auto-correct must’ve changed it.
19756,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,"Yeah, it’s hysterical."
19757,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,"All right, look, just forget about the astronaut."
19758,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Amy,Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?
19759,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,"Look, just find out what’s up with this trip to India."
19760,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,I don’t want to do this anymore!
19761,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Penny,Don’t you quit on us!
19762,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Howard,"Bernie, you okay?"
19763,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,It was an architect!
19764,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You’re a good friend."
19765,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,I’m glad you think so. That’s what I strive to emulate.
19766,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"Okay, let’s see if this drug works."
19767,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Woman at table,Can I help you?
19768,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"Forgive me for staring, but you’re very beautiful."
19769,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Woman,Thank you. That’s a great accent. Where are you from?
19770,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,India.
19771,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Woman,"Oh, cool. I’ve always wanted to go there."
19772,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,It’s a beautiful country. You’d love it. May I join you?
19773,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Woman,"Uh, okay, sure. Why not?"
19774,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
19775,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Woman,Hi.
19776,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"Oh, there’s no need to interact with me. I’m just here to observe."
19777,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Woman,What’s he observing?
19778,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"We’re scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone."
19779,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,All right.
19780,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,And what is your name?
19781,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Woman,Angela.
19782,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"Oh, derived from the word angel. Appropriate."
19783,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Angela,You’re cute.
19784,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,I’d like to buy a scone.
19785,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Server,"Oh, I’m sorry, we’re out. We have muffins."
19786,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,"They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones."
19787,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Angela,What are you doing?
19788,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"Oh, just getting comfortable. So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?"
19789,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Angela,I…
19790,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,They were out of scones.
19791,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"Sheldon, I’m talking to someone. You’re being rude. I’ll bet you’re an actress. If not, you should be. You have a very expressive face."
19792,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Angela,"Oh, my God."
19793,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!"
19794,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Priya,Who wants some more coffee?
19795,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,"Thanks, yeah."
19796,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Howard,Sure.
19797,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,Let me help you.
19798,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Howard,Nice to see that the gals are getting along.
19799,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,"Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?"
19800,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,This trip to India sounds fun.
19801,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Priya,"Yeah, I think it will be."
19802,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?
19803,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Priya,A little. They’re very old-fashioned.
19804,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,"Well, I wouldn’t worry about it. It’s not like you guys are getting engaged, right?"
19805,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Priya,"Oh, God, no. We’re not there yet."
19806,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.
19807,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Priya,You’ve been in there a lot tonight. Are you okay?
19808,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,Yes. Are you writing a book?
19809,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Priya,Why are you getting upset?
19810,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,I’m not upset. Maybe you’re upset.
19811,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Priya,What’s up with you? Bernadette?
19812,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Bernadette,I can’t do this anymore! I’m a good girl! I went to Catholic school!
19813,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Howard,"Okay, well, it’s getting late. This was terrific. You win. Bernie?"
19814,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,I think the word you’re looking for is befuddled.
19815,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,My catapult flings my bishop to Howard’s Queen’s Gorilla two.
19816,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Howard,"Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out at Leonard’s Queen’s Bishop five-and-a-third. Check on Leonard."
19817,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?
19818,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,When it’s done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.
19819,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Leonard,"Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon."
19820,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Sheldon,I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.
19821,4,22,the wildebeest implementation,Raj,"Hey, I’ve got winners."
19822,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"Hey, do me a favour and take table seven."
19823,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,You mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fiancé who’s prone to canker sores and pinkeye?
19824,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless Okie."
19825,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?
19826,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"Oh, please, you’re not that kind of person."
19827,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,I know. But if she orders something low-fat I’ll totally give her the full-fat version.
19828,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,"Uh, that’s my water."
19829,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,What?
19830,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,My water. You’re drinking it.
19831,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?
19832,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,Yes. It’s my water.
19833,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"Well, that’s it then. I’m dead."
19834,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,Here we go.
19835,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend."
19836,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,"Hey! That’s my sister and my country you’re talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won’t have you talking smack about the other."
19837,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,You guys ready to order?
19838,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"Yes, I’d like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint."
19839,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,I don’t understand.
19840,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,He drank from Leonard’s glass.
19841,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,He drank from Leonard’s glass. Words they’ll be carving into my tombstone.
19842,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,That’s actually my napkin.
19843,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, this is a nightmare!"
19844,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,Where are you going?
19845,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"To the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gang way! Dead man walking!"
19846,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,"All right. Here you go. Two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for Priya."
19847,4,23,the engagement reaction,Priya,Is it diet?
19848,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,That’s what you ordered.
19849,4,23,the engagement reaction,Priya,"Thank you. Hey, have you and Howard started planning your wedding yet?"
19850,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,Yeah. We’re thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.
19851,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.
19852,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?
19853,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,He hasn’t told her yet. He’s waiting for the right time.
19854,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.
19855,4,23,the engagement reaction,Priya,"Howard, you’ve got to tell your mother."
19856,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Hey, have you told your parents you’re dating this short glass of skim milk here?"
19857,4,23,the engagement reaction,Priya,"Uh, that’s different. First of all, we’re not engaged, and second, Indian parents are very protective of their children."
19858,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons."
19859,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.
19860,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,You all right?
19861,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.
19862,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,Fire demon.
19863,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,"Ooh, fire demon. Sheldon’s turning up the heat."
19864,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,Troll master.
19865,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!
19866,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,Water nymph.
19867,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,"Oh, yeah, she’s got puddles in all the right places."
19868,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?
19869,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,Sorry. Walking tree.
19870,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,Last one.
19871,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,I’m taking a stroll and I’m sporting wood.
19872,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Okay, the Eagle has landed."
19873,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,What’s going on?
19874,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.
19875,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,"Oh, that sounds lovely."
19876,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Hope so. Of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl."
19877,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,Have you met Bernadette’s parents?
19878,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,You mean Adolf and Eva? Not yet. One goose step at a time.
19879,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,"Sheldon, that’s my water."
19880,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord!"
19881,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,That’s not your water.
19882,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,I know.
19883,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,Where’s the mouthwash?
19884,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,Where indeed.
19885,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Ma, I’m home! Where are you?"
19886,4,23,the engagement reaction,Mrs Wolowitz,I’m in the toilet.
19887,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"So, how’d it go?"
19888,4,23,the engagement reaction,Mrs Wolowitz,Too soon to say. I’m not done yet.
19889,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette."
19890,4,23,the engagement reaction,Mrs Wolowitz,Oh! I had a pastrami sandwich. She had eggplant lasagna. Like that’s what a person orders in a Jewish deli.
19891,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?"
19892,4,23,the engagement reaction,Mrs Wolowitz,"Oh, sure. Did you know she’s going to school to become a microbiologist?"
19893,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"No, she never mentioned it."
19894,4,23,the engagement reaction,Mrs Wolowitz,I bet she did and you didn’t listen.
19895,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Yeah, that’s probably it. So, what do you think? Do you like her? She’s great, huh?"
19896,4,23,the engagement reaction,Mrs Wolowitz,She’s a lovely girl. Cute as a button.
19897,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"That’s good to hear, ’cause I’ve got some news."
19898,4,23,the engagement reaction,Mrs Wolowitz,"I hope it’s good news, because I’ve got nothing but disappointment in here!"
19899,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,Bernadette and I are getting married. Ma? You too busy bearing down? Ma?
19900,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma? Stand back, I’m gonna break the door down!"
19901,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Son of a bitch! Ma, help!"
19902,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,Hey.
19903,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,Hello.
19904,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,Haven’t seen you in a while. How’s it going?
19905,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunky-dory."
19906,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,Did I say something amusing?
19907,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"I don’t know, maybe, I have no idea what you said."
19908,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?
19909,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,My mirth. Classic.
19910,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?
19911,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"It’s not a big deal, Sheldon. It’s just, ever since Leonard’s been dating Raj’s sister, I’ve had to keep my distance. I don’t get to hear all your jibber-jabber."
19912,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,Jibber-jabber? I don’t jibber-jabber.
19913,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,What are you doing at work these days?
19914,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space."
19915,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"Alright, come on, even you have to admit that’s jibber-jabber."
19916,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?"
19917,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"Oh, my God, you’re about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber."
19918,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,"Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go."
19919,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"Oh, my God! What happened?"
19920,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,"I don’t know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry."
19921,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,Okay.
19922,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,"Sheldon, let’s go!"
19923,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don’t think so."
19924,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we’re going."
19925,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,I can’t.
19926,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"Oh, don’t tell me you’re afraid of germs."
19927,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It’s the same way I’m not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax."
19928,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,"Right, fine. I’ll tell Howard you didn’t come because you’re more concerned about your own well-being than his."
19929,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,I would think he would know that.
19930,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it’s time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room."
19931,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"Fine, I’ll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother’s mantel."
19932,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"So I knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room."
19933,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,"You’re a real hero, Howard."
19934,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"No, I did what any son would do."
19935,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"Hang on a second, you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that."
19936,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,I was filled with adrenaline. It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.
19937,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"Yeah, I’m saying, it’d be easier to lift a car."
19938,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable."
19939,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,"So, how is she?"
19940,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,They’re running tests. I don’t know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.
19941,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,What’s the difference?
19942,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,A heart-attack-like event is an event that’s like a heart attack.
19943,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,Thanks for clearing that up.
19944,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. What’s more likely going to kill Howard’s mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital."
19945,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"Okay, you’re not helping."
19946,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,Disagree.
19947,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,Go sit over there.
19948,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"I’ll sit over there, it looks cleaner."
19949,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,Is there a history of heart disease in your family?
19950,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,My family is the history of heart disease. There’s a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this
19951,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,So it’s probably genetic.
19952,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her."
19953,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,What?
19954,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,It’s not important.
19955,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,"Come on, Howard, I’m going to be your wife. You can share anything with me."
19956,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,You’d think that. But no.
19957,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,You told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?
19958,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,You can’t take that personally.
19959,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,How else is she supposed to take it?
19960,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"What you’ve got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left, I’ve been the whole world to my mother. I mean, she’d be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can’t."
19961,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,You mean sexual intercourse?
19962,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy."
19963,4,23,the engagement reaction,Priya,What happened?
19964,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,Howard’s mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she can’t.
19965,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Bernie, wait!"
19966,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"I’ll give you $1,000 if you’ll drive me home."
19967,4,23,the engagement reaction,Priya,Nice of you to come for Howard.
19968,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"Well, he’s my friend. It’s what you do."
19969,4,23,the engagement reaction,Priya,"I’m sorry, did I miss something?"
19970,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"It’s just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose."
19971,4,23,the engagement reaction,Priya,That’s a little easier to believe than he’s your friend.
19972,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"Yeah, tell me about it."
19973,4,23,the engagement reaction,Priya,"You know, my brother had a group of friends like this in India. They dressed up in leotards and goggles and called themselves the New Delhi Power Rangers."
19974,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,You mean when he was little.
19975,4,23,the engagement reaction,Priya,Not as little as you’d want him to be.
19976,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"You know, this stuff is horrible. You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?"
19977,4,23,the engagement reaction,Priya,Sure. We’re going to the cafeteria to get some coffee. You want anything?
19978,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,I’m fine. That’s nice that they’re getting along.
19979,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,"Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you."
19980,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,What are you talking about?
19981,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?
19982,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,I don’t care. I don’t have anything to hide.
19983,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,"Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about."
19984,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,"No, I do not. You are a mean little man."
19985,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,"You’d think it’d be because my parents didn’t love me, but actually they loved me a great deal."
19986,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Bernie, it’s not you. She’s just set in her ways."
19987,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?
19988,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"It’s the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you."
19989,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"Howard, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home."
19990,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,What’s wrong with the bathroom here?
19991,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses."
19992,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancée is grief-stricken over putting her there. I’m not taking you home."
19993,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?"
19994,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,No!
19995,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!"
19996,4,23,the engagement reaction,Doctor,Mr. Wolowitz?
19997,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,Is she okay?
19998,4,23,the engagement reaction,Doctor,"It wasn’t a heart attack. She’s awake, she’s resting comfortably. We’re still running a few tests."
19999,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,Can I see her?
20000,4,23,the engagement reaction,Doctor,"Actually, she said, and I quote, she’d like to see the little Catholic girl first."
20001,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,Me? Why me?
20002,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,Jews have been asking that for centuries. There’s no real good answer.
20003,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,"Okay, well, wish me luck."
20004,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. Let’s just hide Mr. Cross. If it touches her, it burns."
20005,4,23,the engagement reaction,Doctor,You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother?
20006,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,Yeah.
20007,4,23,the engagement reaction,Doctor,Why don’t I write you a prescription for Xanax.
20008,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,Finally.
20009,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, what fresh hell is this?"
20010,4,23,the engagement reaction,Doctor,"Wait, you can’t leave here, you’ve been exposed."
20011,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"No, I haven’t. It’s all good."
20012,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"You want to talk about crazy mothers, Leonard’s mom wouldn’t give him any sort of approval growing up."
20013,4,23,the engagement reaction,Priya,"Oh, the poor thing."
20014,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,It makes him desperate to please women. That’s why the foreplay goes on and on.
20015,4,23,the engagement reaction,Priya,"It does, doesn’t it?"
20016,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"It’s like he’s trying to win a prize. A word of advice, don’t doze off. You will never hear the end of it."
20017,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,Help me! Come back! Penny!
20018,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,"There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly, but…"
20019,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,Like what?
20020,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,"Every once in a while, before we’d go to bed, I’d put on a little show for her."
20021,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,"What do you mean, a show?"
20022,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,"Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off."
20023,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,"Like, to music?"
20024,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,I’d look pretty stupid if there was no music.
20025,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,So you’d do a striptease?
20026,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,I wasn’t swinging around a pole.
20027,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,"Good, good."
20028,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,There was one time I put body glitter on.
20029,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,"Well, I don’t think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that."
20030,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,"No, she wouldn’t."
20031,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,Your big problem is me telling her.
20032,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,You really are a mean little man.
20033,4,23,the engagement reaction,Priya,"Oh, God, that’s so true."
20034,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,"Yeah, I know, right?"
20035,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,"Hey, what took you guys so long?"
20036,4,23,the engagement reaction,Priya,"Oh, we were just chatting."
20037,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,That’s nice. What about?
20038,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,We were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.
20039,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,That’s funny.
20040,4,23,the engagement reaction,Penny,Yeah.
20041,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,What if she wasn’t kidding?
20042,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,It doesn’t matter. I’m the king of foreplay.
20043,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Hey, how’d it go?"
20044,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,You’re a putz. You know what that means?
20045,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,Yeah. Do you?
20046,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,Your mother just taught it to me. She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.
20047,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,And are you?
20048,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,"No, because I’m engaged to a putz. You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack."
20049,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Well, based on the available evid…"
20050,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bernadette,Shut up! She said I’m a wonderful girl and that you’re lucky to have me.
20051,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,Where are you going?
20052,4,23,the engagement reaction,Bermadette,To the toilet! Is that okay with you?
20053,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"Is it just me, or does she sound sexy when she’s angry?"
20054,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,Mountain Elf.
20055,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,He takes the elf from off the shelf.
20056,4,23,the engagement reaction,Leonard,Hell Hounds.
20057,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,Hell Hounds. Who let the Satanic dogs out? Who? Who-who?
20058,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,Colossal Serpent.
20059,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,I got a colossal serpent right here.
20060,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,Must you?
20061,4,23,the engagement reaction,Raj,"Sorry, I’m just trying to cheer my buddy up. Rotting Zombie. Sheldon’s new Facebook photo."
20062,4,23,the engagement reaction,Sheldon,"Zandor, Wizard of the North. Ha! I win."
20063,4,23,the engagement reaction,Howard,"If you skip the part about being under a two-week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely."
20064,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"Hey, you guys ready to order?"
20065,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,Uh..
20066,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,Sure
20067,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"Okay, Priya?"
20068,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Priya,"Uh, I’ll have the Shepherd’s Pie. You want to split that with me?"
20069,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"Oh, no, no, no, he doesn’t."
20070,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Priya,Why not?
20071,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy’s Day balloon."
20072,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"Not quite accurate. The Macy’s balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane."
20073,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"So, no, on the Shepherd’s Pie. Can we move on?"
20074,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"Yeah, a little tip he says he can eat frozen yoghurt. Do not believe it."
20075,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,Sea bass. I’ll have the sea bass.
20076,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,"You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty."
20077,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,Kill me.
20078,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,It wouldn’help. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.
20079,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Bernadette,"Guys, sorry I’m late. I have amazing news."
20080,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonard’s faulty digestive system?"
20081,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"So, what’s your news, Bernadette?"
20082,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Bernadette,The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. I’m getting my PhD.
20083,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,Oh!
20084,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"Oh, congratulations."
20085,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"Wow, so that means you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors."
20086,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,"Congratulations, honey."
20087,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Bernadette,Thank you.
20088,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"So, Howard, tell us, how’s it feel knowing that when you two get married, you’ll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?"
20089,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"Unless he takes Bernadette’s last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him."
20090,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,"Please, this isn’t about me. I’m proud of you."
20091,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Bernadette,"Well, you’ll be really be proud of this. I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. They’re gonna pay me a buttload of money!"
20092,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,What?
20093,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"Bernadette, that’s great. Howard, do you make a buttload?"
20094,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,Better than what you’ve got a buttload of.
20095,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything’s peachy. If you do it, you’re still not a doctor."
20096,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy."
20097,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Oh, if there was a problem, you can’t solve it, check out the hook while my DJ revolves it. Ice, Ice, baby. Ice, Ice, baby."
20098,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Oh, God, I feel ridiculous in this dress."
20099,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now prepare for inspection."
20100,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Priya,"Shh, my brother’s going to hear you."
20101,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"Relax, he’s got headphones on. And we’re ten miles above Earth in a starship."
20102,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Really, ten miles? You’re orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron."
20103,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Priya,I can’t believe I’m wearing my brother’s Halloween costume.
20104,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"I can’t believe you think he only wears it on Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching."
20105,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Okay, gotta go."
20106,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,"Hey, what’s up?"
20107,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Mrs Wolowitz,"Is that my future daughter-in-law, the doctor?"
20108,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,"No, Ma! It’s Raj!"
20109,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Mrs Wolowitz,"He’s a doctor too, right?"
20110,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,Yes!
20111,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Mrs Wolowitz,Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!
20112,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,"Sheldon, yes! Everybody’s a doctor but me!"
20113,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Mrs Wolowitz,"Well, whose fault is that?"
20114,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,What’s up?
20115,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,Leonard’s putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. Can I stay here tonight?
20116,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,"Sure, but I’m going out with Bernadette. It’ll just be you and my mother."
20117,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,I guess that’s okay.
20118,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,"Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!"
20119,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Mrs Wolowitz,"Of course, he and I can play doctor!"
20120,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"She’s kidding, right?"
20121,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,"I don’t know, she’s pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy."
20122,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Mrs Wolowitz,Paging Dr. Cutie Pie!
20123,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD."
20124,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Amy,"It’s indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology."
20125,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.
20126,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Amy,"I’ll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck?"
20127,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,It’s a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.
20128,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Amy,Have you considered massage?
20129,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"I’d like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it."
20130,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Amy,I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.
20131,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.
20132,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Amy,"Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process."
20133,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,All right.
20134,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Amy,"Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so."
20135,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,Rotating.
20136,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Amy,You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.
20137,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,You mean the myofascial point?
20138,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Amy,Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.
20139,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, I’ve never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!"
20140,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Amy,Don’t flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.
20141,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,There’s someone at my door.
20142,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Amy,That doesn’t interest me. Goodbye.
20143,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,Can I sleep here tonight?
20144,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,Why?
20145,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,Leonard’s having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.
20146,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I’ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.
20147,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Oh, don’t bother. I’ll just sleep in Leonard’s room."
20148,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"No, I can’t authorize that."
20149,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Well, he’s in my bed. Why can’t I be in his?"
20150,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed."
20151,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Come on, dude, I’m exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night’s sleep."
20152,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard’s bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression."
20153,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Good night, Sheldon."
20154,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. In the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit."
20155,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,You’re kidding.
20156,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,I never kid about safety.
20157,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,What are you doing here?
20158,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,I was sleeping.
20159,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,In my bed?
20160,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Well, I would’ve slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry."
20161,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"Oh, you heard?"
20162,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Scotty, I need more power."
20163,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,Sorry. Does Sheldon know you’re sleeping in here?
20164,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy."
20165,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?"
20166,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Oh, my God, she’s that Mona? Why can’t you and my sister spend your nights here?"
20167,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,We tried. She doesn’t get along with Sheldon.
20168,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,Sheldon doesn’t get along with Sheldon. It’s still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.
20169,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I’ll stay at your apartment."
20170,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,Can I bring girls here?
20171,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.
20172,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Okay, deal."
20173,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,Just not against their will.
20174,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,Do you really think you should be eating that cake?
20175,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,Why?
20176,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"If you’re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline."
20177,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"He’s right. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips."
20178,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,"Yeah, ha-ha. First of all, I’m not threatened by my fiancée’s success. I’m proud of her. And secondly, I have my own career."
20179,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,Until you have kids.
20180,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You’re okay to stay for a while."
20181,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,When did you take my blood?
20182,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I’d follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over."
20183,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,What the hell is this?
20184,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.
20185,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,This says you can make end of life decisions for me.
20186,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"As your friend, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. Please sign."
20187,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,Did you sign this?
20188,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"There’s a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too."
20189,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Well, that seems fair."
20190,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here’s your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air."
20191,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase."
20192,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"Also, you’re tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You’ll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions, here’s the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights."
20193,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,No backsies.
20194,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Sheldon, dinner!"
20195,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,What is this?
20196,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,This is the difference between eating and dining.
20197,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,Remarkable. I’m just realizing how much Leonard’s been skating by all these years.
20198,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,It’s not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.
20199,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?"
20200,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"Yes, it’s “Penny, get your own Wi-Fi.” No spaces."
20201,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,Thanks. Wow! What’s with the fancy spread?
20202,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me.
20203,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"Uh, nice touch, by the way."
20204,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?"
20205,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.
20206,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,I’m the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.
20207,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"All right, let me try this again. Where’s Leonard?"
20208,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"He’s living at my place, so I’m living here."
20209,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,You’re living here provisionally. But I must say it’s looking good.
20210,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That’s big."
20211,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"No. Origami napkin swans, that’s the headline."
20212,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,It’s a good thing.
20213,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,So do you know what kind of research you’ll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?
20214,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Bernadette,"Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. I mean, it’s not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present."
20215,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,"Oh, Bernie, no. You didn’t have to."
20216,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Bernadette,"I wanted to. Come on, open it."
20217,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,You bought me a Rolex? How much did this cost?
20218,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Bernadette,"Oh, you let me worry about the money. I just want my baby to have pretty things."
20219,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,More wine?
20220,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"Oh, no, no, no. I’ve had way too much already."
20221,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,Here’s an interesting fact about alcohol.
20222,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,Hit me.
20223,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks."
20224,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,Monkeys.
20225,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,When does a monkey have a trunk?
20226,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,When a suitcase just won’t do.
20227,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire."
20228,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I’ve got to get me some of that?"
20229,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Well, it’s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment."
20230,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonard’s a noisy little dude in the sack."
20231,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,Every night.
20232,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?"
20233,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,It’s my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?
20234,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?"
20235,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,Yeah.
20236,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,I screwed up. Leonard’s a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.
20237,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare, It’s better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography."
20238,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"Oh, you poor baby."
20239,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"What’s wrong with me, Penny?"
20240,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren’t friends, and you hadn’t brought up that creepy pornography story, I’d be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy."
20241,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,"Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared."
20242,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship."
20243,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Raj,To friendship.
20244,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? And the answer was elephant!
20245,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,Mmm. Mmm.
20246,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Priya,"Leonard, sweetheart, we’re kissing, not eating hot soup."
20247,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,Sorry.
20248,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Priya,That’s my parents on video chat. Go hide in the bedroom.
20249,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"Oh, come on! Why don’t we just tell them that we’re dating?"
20250,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Priya,"Oh, we’ve been through this. It’s not the time."
20251,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,When is the time?
20252,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Priya,"I’ve got five brothers and sisters. One of them is bound to screw up real big, and then I’ll tell my parents about you. Now, shoo."
20253,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,Fine.
20254,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Priya,"Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy."
20255,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Dr Koothrappali,We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City. Is that close to you?
20256,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Priya,No.
20257,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Mrs Koothrappali,Where is your brother?
20258,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Priya,Out with friends.
20259,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Dr Koothrappali,"I don’t like it, a young girl alone in an apartment."
20260,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Mrs Koothrappali,I’ll sleep so much better when you move back here next month.
20261,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,You’re moving back to India?
20262,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Dr Koothrappali,Who’s that?
20263,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Mrs Koothrappali,"Oh, my God! There’s someone in your apartment. Call the police in America!"
20264,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,When were you going to tell me about this?
20265,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Priya,"Oh, hello, Leonard. What a pleasant surprise! Mummy, Daddy, you remember Rajesh’s friend Leonard."
20266,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Dr Koothrappali,I thought you said Rajesh was out with his friends.
20267,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Priya,He has many friends.
20268,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Dr Koothrappali,Rajesh has many friends?
20269,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Mrs Koothrappali,Why are you lying to us?
20270,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,She’s lying because she doesn’t want you to know we’re dating.
20271,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Priya,Leonard!
20272,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,"Well, what difference does it make? If you’re moving back to India, we’re obviously breaking up."
20273,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Priya,You know what? I don’t want to deal with this right now.
20274,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,So. Hot in India?
20275,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Dr Koothrappali,"Of course it is. It always is. It’s India. Now, what do you have to say for yourself?"
20276,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.
20277,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh. Okay, look. This never happened. Do you understand me?"
20278,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,Really? Still can’t talk to me?
20279,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,What are you doing here?
20280,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,What?
20281,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"I said, what are you doing here?"
20282,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,I live here.
20283,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,I have paperwork that says differently.
20284,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,Priya’s going back to India.
20285,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you’re not going to ruin it.
20286,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,What are you doing here?
20287,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,I’ve been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.
20288,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,Why?
20289,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Howard,She gave me a beautiful watch.
20290,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,"Leonard, do you understand this?"
20291,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,Yes.
20292,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,Talk to him.
20293,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,Damn.
20294,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Leonard,What’s going on?
20295,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Penny,"Oh. It’s, it’s not what it looks like."
20296,4,24,the roommate transmogrification,Sheldon,What does it look like?
20297,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,It’s not what it looks like. It’s not what it looks like.
20298,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,What are you grinding about?
20299,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"Penny’s brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue, it’s not what it looks like."
20300,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"Just let it go, Sheldon."
20301,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"If I could, I would, but I can’t, so I shan’t. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that’s what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let’s put on our thinking cap, shall we?"
20302,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"Raj is from India, a tropical country. Third World hygiene. Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms. Mm-hmm. The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air."
20303,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj’s anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. That’s a true blue friend."
20304,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"They slept together, Sherlock."
20305,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"No, you weren’t listening. She said, it’s not what it looks like."
20306,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,She lied.
20307,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,Oh. Well don’t I look silly sitting here wearing this?
20308,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Howard,Hey.
20309,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,Hey.
20310,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,Hey.
20311,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"Hey. Leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?"
20312,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"No, I’m fine with it."
20313,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"That sounds like sarcasm, but I’m going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I don’t see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can’t be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were."
20314,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,What the hell is wrong with you?
20315,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Howard,"Yeah, how could you do that?"
20316,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,What is it to you?
20317,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Howard,I got his back.
20318,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"Yeah, right. You’re just jealous because it turns out I’m Penny’s number two choice after Leonard."
20319,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Howard,"Hey, if I wasn’t engaged to Bernadette, that totally could have been me."
20320,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals."
20321,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"Why do you care so much? You’re dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love."
20322,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard and Howard together,What?
20323,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, if I may interject, I’ve decided my rank will be captain. If it’s good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, it’s good enough for me."
20324,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Howard,You’re not in love with Penny.
20325,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"Yes, I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love."
20326,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Howard,Who?
20327,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"He’s the Hindu version of Cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot."
20328,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee."
20329,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Howard,I’m sorry. What?
20330,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,Rubbish. He’s talking rubbish.
20331,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet."
20332,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I’m the dusky half of Koothrapenny."
20333,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"For the record, I do have genitals. They’re functional and aesthetically pleasing."
20334,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Coming. Yup, that’s good. Wine glasses should have handles."
20335,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. Smart idea considering how trampy you get when you’ve had a few.
20336,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,You heard what I did?
20337,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,"Well, I heard who you did."
20338,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore."
20339,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,Don’t be so hard on yourself. Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?
20340,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,No.
20341,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,"She ruled Russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse."
20342,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,I’m… I’m sorry. What does this have to do with me?
20343,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,"She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. I’m sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little Indian boy."
20344,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Bernadette,You jerk face! What did you tell Howard? Did you say there was something going on between us? Because he thinks there is. He’s completely freaking out!
20345,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"Please, come in."
20346,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Bernadette,What the hell is wrong with you?
20347,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"Well, you were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me."
20348,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Bernadette,I’m nice to everyone.
20349,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,I’m sorry.
20350,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Bernadette,"Damn right, you’re sorry. And you tell Howard there’s never been anything between us."
20351,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"I will. Hey, Bernadette?"
20352,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Bernadette,What?!
20353,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,Do you think I have a shot with Penny?
20354,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Bernadette,Of course you do. You’re a cutie pie. Any girl would be lucky to have you.
20355,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"You know, I’ve done this before. In kindergarten, I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants."
20356,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,"You can’t blame yourself. When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. We neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex."
20357,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,You know what? Let’s get out of here.
20358,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,Where are we going?
20359,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Somewhere where no one’s seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile.
20360,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"Subtlety isn’t her strong suit, is it?"
20361,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Can I stay at your place for a few nights?
20362,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,Really? A best friend sleepover? Yay.
20363,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Yeah, sure. Yay!"
20364,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,"We’ll make popcorn, stay up all night and I’ll teach you my secret language, Op."
20365,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Sounds great.
20366,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,Nope. Sounds Gop Rop E A Top.
20367,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Yeah, I’m gonna go pack a bag."
20368,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,"No, you’re not. You’re gonna Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop."
20369,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?
20370,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can’t see you."
20371,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"I’m not in the mood, Sheldon."
20372,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"Oh, there you are. Leonard, I know you’re upset about recent events, and I have someone here to help."
20373,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,I don’t want to talk to Amy.
20374,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"No, it’s not Amy."
20375,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Dr Hofstadter,"Hello, dear."
20376,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,You called my mother?
20377,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?"
20378,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Dr Hofstadter,"He’s been like that since he was a toddler. Look, Mommy, a butterfly. Maddening."
20379,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,What’s going on? What do you want?
20380,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Dr Hofstadter,"Sheldon informed me that you’re experiencing an emotional upheaval, and I’m here to help."
20381,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,That’s so nice.
20382,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Dr Hofstadter,"And we’re back to the obvious. Now, what’s up?"
20383,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"Well, uh, okay, um, I don’t want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn’t work, but I can’t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj’s sister Priya, who I’ve been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I’m just completely confused and alone."
20384,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Dr Hofstadter,I understand.
20385,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,Got any advice?
20386,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Dr Hofstadter,Yes. Buck up.
20387,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"Excuse me. You’re a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you’ve got is buck up?"
20388,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Dr Hofstadter,"Sorry. Buck up, sissy pants."
20389,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"Thanks, Mother. I feel much better."
20390,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Dr Hofstadter,"If you need any more help from me, my books are available on Amazon. Logging off."
20391,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,"Ninety-nine, one hundred. It’s like a waterfall of liquid gold. My turn."
20392,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"You know, I don’t even know what the point of me staying in L.A. is. I haven’t gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month, I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial."
20393,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,"Oh, I could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids."
20394,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"I know, right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska."
20395,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,"No, I can’t let you do that."
20396,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Why not?
20397,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,"For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life. And no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you."
20398,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"Hi, Amy. Can I talk to Penny?"
20399,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door? I wish I could tell 13-year-old me it does get better.
20400,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,How did you know I was here?
20401,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,It’s all over her Facebook page.
20402,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,I’ll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer.
20403,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Thanks.
20404,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Amy,"No problem. Try and keep it in your pants, okay?"
20405,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"So, hi. What’s up?"
20406,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"I was wondering if you’re free Friday. They’re having a Totally ’80s Night at the Greek. Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo."
20407,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Oh. Gee, that’s really sweet, but the thing is…"
20408,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"Aw, there’s a thing."
20409,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We should’ve never slept together. It’s what ruins friendships."
20410,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,You can’t ruin a friendship with sex. That’s like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.
20411,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Come here. Just listen to me. I want to go back to the way we were before. You know, friends. No sprinkles."
20412,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,Oh. All right.
20413,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Thank you.
20414,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"Well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn’t have sex in the conventional sense."
20415,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?"
20416,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"No, no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection."
20417,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Oh, you did, didn’t you?"
20418,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"Of course. I’m always packing. Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote."
20419,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"So, we didn’t actually…"
20420,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,I did. It was beautiful.
20421,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Oh!
20422,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"Penny, please, please promise me you won’t tell anybody about this."
20423,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Of course I won’t. No, I won’t."
20424,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"Oh, good. Um, can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?"
20425,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Sure.
20426,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all, I want to have your babies, and I was like, I’m too rock and roll to be tied down?"
20427,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,No.
20428,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,Can I say I ruined you for white men?
20429,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Also no.
20430,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"Okay, just the candle thing."
20431,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Yeah.
20432,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,Cool. All right friend.
20433,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Hmm.
20434,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,I’ll see you around.
20435,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Okay. Raj, wait. Thank you for being my friend."
20436,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,Penny?
20437,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Mm-hmm?
20438,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,It’s getting beautiful again.
20439,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle."
20440,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Howard,I don’t see anything.
20441,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"Give it a second to load. Whenever you’re ready, AT&T! Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, they’re out of sunblock, which means they’ll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That’s our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won’t know what hit them. All right, let’s move out."
20442,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?"
20443,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Howard,Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee.
20444,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.
20445,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"You know what, guys, I’m not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?"
20446,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Howard,Fine with me.
20447,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"Sure, whatever."
20448,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,You can’t quit. That’s a court-martial offence. That’s punishable by… You can’t quit.
20449,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"Sorry, Sheldon, it’s just not a good time for playing games."
20450,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"This is a game to you? Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?"
20451,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"Yes, no and no."
20452,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn’t your fault, it’s mine. I haven’t earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership, apparently I more than make up for in sewing."
20453,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Howard,"Let it go, Sheldon. I’ll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home."
20454,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that’s what we’re going to be.
20455,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,What are you doing?
20456,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo."
20457,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,Geology isn’t a real science!
20458,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Howard,Damn those sons of bitches!
20459,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,Let’s get ’em!
20460,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"If there’s ever a Church of Sheldon, this will be when it started. Ow!"
20461,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"I’d like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, Captain Sheldon Cooper."
20462,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Howard and Raj,"Here, here."
20463,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,"Excuse me. It’s Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath, I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It’s kind of a big deal."
20464,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Hi. You guys have a minute?
20465,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, sure."
20466,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Okay. Um. Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything."
20467,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,"Please, Penny, let me. We’ve decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you’re feeling blue or you’re in the shower."
20468,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?"
20469,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Raj,Sorry. Go on.
20470,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I’ve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It’s time for me to move back to Nebraska."
20471,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,You’re leaving?
20472,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Yeah.
20473,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Howard,What are you going to do in Nebraska?
20474,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"I don’t know, maybe teach acting."
20475,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Oh, sorry. Hold on. Hello?"
20476,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,"Penny, Penny, listen, I hope you’re not doing this ’cause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and you’re a single woman."
20477,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Shh! It’s my agent, it’s my agent. You’re kidding. Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe it! Really? Oh, I’m so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday."
20478,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,What about Nebraska?
20479,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"Oh, hell with Nebraska. I’m gonna be a star!"
20480,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Sheldon,Have you ever thought of teaching physics?
20481,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Actress,Ready to ride?
20482,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,"I don’t think so, Mom. Not today."
20483,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Actress,"Oh, sweetie. Haemorrhoids acting up again?"
20484,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,You don’t know the half of it.
20485,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Actress,"Oh, yes, I do. Try a dab of this."
20486,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?
20487,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Actress,"Now, the H is for Her."
20488,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Leonard,I’m proud of you.
20489,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Shh! Here comes my joke.
20490,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Actress,How are you doing?
20491,5,1,the skank reflex analysis,Penny,Sittin’ pretty.
20492,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,What are you doing?
20493,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, uh, Priya’s calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date."
20494,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,It’s eight o’clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?
20495,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast."
20496,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"All right, so technically it’s not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you’d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?"
20497,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,That doesn’t sound like mocking.
20498,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,You didn’t let me finish. Dinfast . Are those soy-based candles?
20499,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,I don’t know. Why?
20500,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast
20501,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Listen, I don’t want to be rude, but Priya’s gonna be calling any minute, so…"
20502,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs."
20503,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Yes, I’ve always admired that about you."
20504,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,As well you should. But I’m going to make an exception here.
20505,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, good."
20506,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby."
20507,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,A hobby?
20508,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.
20509,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"You know, some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance. They’d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you."
20510,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized."
20511,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?
20512,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Don’t you like Amy?
20513,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,Of course I like Amy.
20514,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"Well, there’s the difference."
20515,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Excuse me, that’s Priya."
20516,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,"Hi, Leonard."
20517,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Hey, honey."
20518,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,I miss you.
20519,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, I miss you, too."
20520,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.
20521,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.
20522,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"Oh, it’s no problem. It’s actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We’re like an old married couple."
20523,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles."
20524,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,I don’t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.
20525,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,A good wife would go to the store.
20526,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,I want a divorce.
20527,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair."
20528,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"It’s great, isn’t it?"
20529,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name."
20530,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,What name?
20531,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Chair.
20532,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"Oh, all right, well, I’m glad you like it. I mean, I still can’t get over the fact someone just threw it away."
20533,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,What?
20534,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here."
20535,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear."
20536,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,What is wrong?
20537,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,I’ve been sitting in garbage!
20538,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"Sheldon, take it easy."
20539,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,You take it easy! I need to use your shower.
20540,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,I went into this marriage with so much hope.
20541,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,There’s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor.
20542,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Raj,This is fun. I’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.
20543,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,"Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand."
20544,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,That’s three minutes. Should we see what we got?
20545,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,Hang on.
20546,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Raj,"Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini."
20547,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,Hand me the tuna melt.
20548,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,Yep.
20549,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,Thank you. How’s it going with the long-distance love affair?
20550,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Not easy, but we’re making it work."
20551,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,"When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?"
20552,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,What?
20553,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,"You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow."
20554,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Raj,"Come on, dude. This is my sister you’re talking about."
20555,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,"Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it."
20556,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,There’s no junk jiggling. We just talk.
20557,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,"Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth."
20558,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,I can’t do that.
20559,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,"Well, if you don’t, you’re gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books."
20560,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Raj,How can you be so racist?
20561,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,"Oh, come on, tell me I’m wrong."
20562,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice."
20563,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"I did it last night, I’m not doing it again."
20564,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,"Just his head, right?"
20565,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,I don’t want to talk about it. You didn’t catch bugs from Penny’s chair.
20566,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"Yes, I did. And now they’re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest."
20567,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion."
20568,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Name one time I’ve ever done that.
20569,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you’d started growing again.
20570,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills."
20571,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Penny. Penny. Penny.
20572,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,Yello.
20573,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,You need to remove that chair from the building. It’s a health hazard.
20574,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions."
20575,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Really?
20576,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,Yeah. It’s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.
20577,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That’s reassuring.
20578,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"Why don’t you give it a try, Sheldon?"
20579,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,All right. It is a comfortable chair.
20580,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,Why don’t you just admit you overreacted?
20581,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"No, thank you."
20582,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,It’s like living with a Chihuahua.
20583,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Penny. Penny. Penny.
20584,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"What’s up, buttercup?"
20585,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,You have to get rid of the chair.
20586,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,Nope.
20587,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Penny. Penny. Penny.
20588,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"What’s the word, hummingbird?"
20589,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death."
20590,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,No.
20591,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Penny. Penny. Penny.
20592,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"What’s the gist, physicist?"
20593,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned."
20594,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room."
20595,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Penny. Penny. Penny.
20596,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"So, here we are. Back in bed together."
20597,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,"Yep, here we are."
20598,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay, so I, I, I guess I’ll just jump right in."
20599,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,All right.
20600,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Uh, you’re a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?"
20601,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,What?
20602,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,Not good?
20603,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,That’s terrible. Try again.
20604,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay. Uh, uh, you’re not naughty. Uh, you’re, you’re, you’re dirty. You’re, you’re a, a dirty girl?"
20605,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,"Oh, yes. Yes, I am."
20606,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You’re a, you’re a, you’re a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!"
20607,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,"God, Leonard, stop talking."
20608,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,Why don’t you just give me five minutes? I’ll Google how to do this. I’ll call you right back.
20609,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,Shh-shh-shh. Just be quiet and do what I tell you.
20610,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay, like usual. Good."
20611,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,Take off your shirt.
20612,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.
20613,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,I said be quiet.
20614,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Yes, ma’am."
20615,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,Now take off your shorts.
20616,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!"
20617,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,Wonderful. Now I’ll take off my clothes.
20618,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,Cool.
20619,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,"Here I am, baby. You miss these?"
20620,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, damn it!"
20621,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,"Oh, Leonard! Already?"
20622,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It’s probably just buffering, just give it a second."
20623,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,Fine.
20624,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"So, how are your mom and dad?"
20625,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,"Yeah, I really don’t want to talk about my parents now."
20626,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah. Sure, sure."
20627,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"If your video’s frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack."
20628,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,Oh! I didn’t even think of that. Thanks.
20629,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,You’re welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I’m trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.
20630,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,"Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes…"
20631,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Amy. Amy. Amy.
20632,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,Oh… You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?
20633,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"Is not. Is not, is not."
20634,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,"Denial. Denial, denial. Come in."
20635,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Thank you.
20636,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?
20637,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,No.
20638,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff’rent Strokes? Now the world don’t move to the beat…
20639,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,No.
20640,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,"Well, that’s every song I know. What’s up?"
20641,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"You’re good friends with Penny, right?"
20642,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,"Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on."
20643,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.
20644,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,"For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?"
20645,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Cholera is water-borne. You’re mocking me.
20646,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,"Yes, I am."
20647,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.
20648,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,"Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn’t mean I have to participate."
20649,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"All right, name your price."
20650,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,Kiss me where I’ve never been kissed before.
20651,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,You mean like Salt Lake City?
20652,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,Never mind. I’ll talk to Penny.
20653,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,Thank you.
20654,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,Will you listen to me play my harp now?
20655,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I’m going to experience an episode from my past.
20656,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Mommy. Don’t be mad at me. Don’t do that!"
20657,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"I don’t know about this, Howard."
20658,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,"What? You’re having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you’re doing to hers. See? Internet kissing."
20659,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,I don’t think so.
20660,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Raj,I’ll try it. Like this?
20661,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,"Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor."
20662,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Raj,Like this?
20663,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,Close. Really French it.
20664,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Raj,Better?
20665,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,"Yeah, you got it, you got it."
20666,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Raj,I’m impressed. This is very lifelike.
20667,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,Whoa! You just bit my tongue!
20668,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Raj,"I, I nibbled. I was being playful."
20669,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,Why do you have to make everything weird?
20670,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Raj,Sorry. Better?
20671,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,"Oh, yeah."
20672,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store."
20673,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.
20674,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,You’re kidding.
20675,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,Everything except bra and panties. And they’re a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.
20676,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,And now me.
20677,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,I just have one question about the chair.
20678,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,And what’s that?
20679,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,Aren’t you worried about it being unhygienic?
20680,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"No, it’s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this."
20681,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,"No, he didn’t."
20682,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,Really?
20683,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,"Yes, he did. He absolutely did."
20684,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"My God, Amy, that’s really crappy of you."
20685,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,It is?
20686,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.
20687,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,"No, I am your friend. Please don’t be mad at me."
20688,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"I can’t even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go."
20689,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,"No, no, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I’m, uh, I’m sitting in your chair. There’s nothing wrong with it. It’s a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!"
20690,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,What’s wrong?
20691,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,Something in the chair’s biting my tushy. It’s not important. Ow!
20692,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"Wait. Get up, get up!"
20693,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,Swear you won’t tell Sheldon what happened!
20694,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Amy,I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I’m probably gonna need shots!
20695,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah, sure!"
20696,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out."
20697,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,"Oh, Leonard, listen…"
20698,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"No, you listen. You’re my woman, and I’m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before."
20699,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,Leonard…
20700,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Leonard,"That’s right, say my name, and beg me for more, ’cause, I’m gonna give it to you."
20701,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Priya,My parents are here.
20702,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Dr Koothrappali,"Hello, Leonard, if I may also say your name."
20703,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,Check it out. Free chair.
20704,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Raj,"Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment, I wouldn’t wind up sitting on the floor all the time."
20705,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Howard,On three?
20706,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Together,Three!
20707,5,2,the infestation hypothesis,Raj,What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?
20708,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,Who wants the last dumpling?
20709,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Penny,"Ooh, me."
20710,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,"Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group."
20711,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Penny,Thank you all for this high honour.
20712,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,"I’ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating."
20713,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"All right, honey, if we’re gonna make the movie, we should go."
20714,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fiancée."
20715,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Yeah, well, now it means her."
20716,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,It’s okay if he wants to come.
20717,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Fine. But next time, we get a sitter."
20718,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Penny,"All right, I got to go to work. I’ll walk down with you."
20719,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,"Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?"
20720,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,Neither of them are close.
20721,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,"Oh, well, then I guess it doesn’t matter which one of you drives me. Let’s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer’s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt."
20722,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Penny,"Okay, I’m not driving him."
20723,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,"No, Penny, don’t give up, you can get this."
20724,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,Aren’t you going with Sheldon?
20725,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele."
20726,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so…"
20727,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,I can’t imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.
20728,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,Okay. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable at home?
20729,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"Not really, no."
20730,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,All righty then. Guess I’ll just get started.
20731,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"Leonard, please. I don’t need the running commentary."
20732,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,Amy?
20733,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,Yo.
20734,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,You okay?
20735,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"Oh, sure."
20736,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,I thought you were reading.
20737,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"I was. Now I’m thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable."
20738,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"I, I’m fine."
20739,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,Should I go? I’ve been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.
20740,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"What, who told you that?"
20741,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"Well, most recently my gynaecologist."
20742,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"Well, you stay as long as you’d like."
20743,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"I’m glad to hear you say that, because I’m having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist."
20744,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,"What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?"
20745,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m not buying anything. They’re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic."
20746,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,Which side do you come down on?
20747,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,"I’ll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I’m going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it’s O-gauge or no gauge."
20748,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?
20749,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,That’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother’s house.
20750,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"First of all, they’re not tricks, they’re illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they’re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes."
20751,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,Why would I keep clothes at your mother’s house?
20752,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Well, don’t think of it that way. Once we move in, it’ll be our house."
20753,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,Is she moving out?
20754,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,Why would she move out? It’s her house.
20755,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,Hang on. You seriously think I’m going to live with your mother?
20756,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,"Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that’s exactly what he thinks."
20757,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Why not? It’s a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom’s there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin."
20758,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,"I’m not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever."
20759,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues."
20760,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,"Raj, take me home."
20761,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,Don’t listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.
20762,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,Take me home now.
20763,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,Movie theatre.
20764,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Raj,Mmmmmm.
20765,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,"Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don’t care what you people do."
20766,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,How was your shower?
20767,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?"
20768,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"Oh, I’m up all night. I’m like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?"
20769,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,Not really. Is that my yearbook?
20770,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you’re really good at science. Maybe one day you’ll come up with a cure for being a dork."
20771,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"Well, it wasn’t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that."
20772,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother."
20773,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,Aw.
20774,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom."
20775,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,"Well, you can add Jerry’s Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again."
20776,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"Rough night, Casey Jones?"
20777,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,You don’t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.
20778,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,What’s in the bag?
20779,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,"I don’t want to talk about it. But it’s not a spine,I’ll tell you that."
20780,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime."
20781,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"Ah, sure. That’d be nice."
20782,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They’re kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.
20783,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,Wouldn’t you rather bring Sheldon?
20784,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time."
20785,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,Not my fault. You said there’d be other scientists there my age.
20786,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"Doesn’t matter. You’re out, he’s in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change."
20787,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,"Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding."
20788,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,I’ll get it!
20789,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Mrs Wolowitz,Could you get it?
20790,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,I said I’m getting it!
20791,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Mrs Wolowitz,"Fine, I’ll get it!"
20792,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"I got it! Oh, hi."
20793,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,Hey. I don’t want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.
20794,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Yeah, well, I’m sorry I didn’t run it by you first."
20795,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Mrs Wolowitz,"I don’t know who you’re talking to, but in or out! We don’t need bugs!"
20796,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"The bugs only come here because you’re their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it’s like."
20797,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,And your mom would be okay with that?
20798,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?"
20799,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Mrs Wolowitz,"Hey, if she’s willing to give the milk away for free, who am I to say no?"
20800,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,See? She’s good with it.
20801,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Mrs Wolowitz,"Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!"
20802,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,"All this years, I’ve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun."
20803,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Penny,You’re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?
20804,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?"
20805,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Penny,Really? For a wedding?
20806,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,Perhaps you’re right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.
20807,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,Ready.
20808,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Penny,Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.
20809,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,"Better than James Bond, because he’s tinier."
20810,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,I got you this to give to me.
20811,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Penny,"Oh, sweetie, guests don’t normally wear corsages to a wedding. That’s more of a prom thing."
20812,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs."
20813,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Penny,Put the corsage on her.
20814,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"Amy, this is for you."
20815,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"When you’re done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist."
20816,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,All aboard! Woo-woo! It’s official. I’m an H-O trainiac.
20817,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"So, dinner went nice."
20818,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,"Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?"
20819,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Only when it’s fatty. Well, don’t be jealous, babe. Someday you’ll get to cut it for me."
20820,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Mrs Wolowitz,Bernadette! I found the extra head for the Waterpik if you want to use it!
20821,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,"I’m okay, Mrs. Wolowitz."
20822,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Mrs Wolowitz,You sure? I just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth!
20823,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?"
20824,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Mrs Wolowitz,"Oh, I know what that means! Hubba-hubba!"
20825,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,"Oh, God."
20826,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Relax, it’ll be fine."
20827,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,Okay.
20828,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Mrs Wolowitz,Let me know when you’re done canoodling! Mommy needs a foot rub!
20829,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,Would you like to dance?
20830,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"No, thank you. I’m really not much of a dancer."
20831,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"You’re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either."
20832,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,I’m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.
20833,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"Why shouldn’t they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we’d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm."
20834,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so…"
20835,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you’re not holding up your end of the evening."
20836,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away."
20837,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who’s playing with a model train right now, you don’t hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you."
20838,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,I’m not moody. I’m fun.
20839,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,You have any evidence to support that statement?
20840,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"Well, hey, I’m just as much fun as you are."
20841,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.
20842,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"Okay, fine, what do you suggest?"
20843,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you’re sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why don’t we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields."
20844,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"Once again, I, I’m really not much of a dancer."
20845,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"Don’t worry, I’ll lead."
20846,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,Howard?
20847,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,Ready for bed?
20848,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,"No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother’s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour."
20849,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight’s not your night!"
20850,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Mrs Wolowitz,You don’t know that! I just sat down!
20851,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!"
20852,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Mrs Wolowitz,She can come in and brush her teeth! I’m not embarrassed!
20853,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,Problem solved.
20854,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,"No, it’s not. I’m not going in there."
20855,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Oh, come on, honey. She’s just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can’t see anything. I go in all the time."
20856,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Mrs Wolowitz,Ha! The eagle has landed!
20857,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"And we have splashdown. Wait here, I’m gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love."
20858,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"There we go, last floor."
20859,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"I just can’t figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped."
20860,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,The hokey pokey is a young man’s game.
20861,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it’s okay to have fun once in a while.
20862,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,You’re welcome.
20863,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.
20864,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely."
20865,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"Well, okay. Again, thank you."
20866,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"And again, you’re welcome."
20867,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"Want to come in, have a cup of tea?"
20868,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"No, thanks. I’m gonna head home."
20869,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"Okay. Well, good night."
20870,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,Good night.
20871,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Penny,"Ames, hi. How was the wedding?"
20872,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.
20873,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Penny,"Come in, let’s talk. Do you want a glass of wine?"
20874,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,Wine is one of the reasons I’m in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.
20875,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Penny,"Okay, I’m sorry, what exactly happened?"
20876,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let’s face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore."
20877,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Penny,"Oh, God, did he make a move on you?"
20878,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"No, but it’s only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I’m gonna have to break the little sad sack’s heart."
20879,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Penny,"Yeah, I’m sure he’ll be okay."
20880,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn’t get my motor running."
20881,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Penny,"So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?"
20882,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Amy,"No. I’ll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I’ll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you’ve got a better shot than he does."
20883,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,"Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth."
20884,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,Sounds like you had a great night.
20885,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,I did. How was yours?
20886,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.
20887,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,What exactly do you mean by that?
20888,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,"Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin’s a little worse for wear."
20889,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,Ow! Why did you do that?
20890,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,To send a message. She is not for you.
20891,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Leonard,What?
20892,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Sheldon,Not for you!
20893,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,"Good morning, handsome."
20894,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Morning, Mom."
20895,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,It’s me.
20896,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Yes, it is, and you’re so pretty in the morning."
20897,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,Your mom and I made you breakfast.
20898,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?"
20899,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,"Yeah, I guess. We’re very different people, Howard, so communication’s a little tricky."
20900,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Mrs Wolowitz,Does he like the pancakes?!
20901,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,He didn’t try them yet!
20902,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,Is there any butter?
20903,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,It’s butter-flavoured syrup.
20904,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,Oh.
20905,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Mrs Wolowitz,"So, what’s the word?"
20906,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,He wants butter!
20907,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Mrs Wolowitz,It’s butter-flavoured syrup
20908,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,I just told him that!
20909,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,I don’t need any butter.
20910,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Bernadette,"If you want butter, I’ll get you butter."
20911,5,3,the pulled groin extrapolation,Howard,"Well, I guess I’ll cut these by myself."
20912,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. What do you do?"
20913,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"I say, hey Ma, what’s for dinner?”"
20914,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too."
20915,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,"Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?"
20916,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,Great. We spent five hours last night at Macy’s registering for gifts. Looks like I’m finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I’ve always wanted.
20917,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,"See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want."
20918,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,You mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?
20919,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,Maybe. We enter the dungeon.
20920,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,You see a dragon.
20921,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"Really? So we’re playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn’t that a little on the nose?"
20922,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?"
20923,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,Are you gonna eat that whole pie?
20924,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?
20925,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,"Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?"
20926,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"No, it’s just that everybody’s got someone. Sheldon’s with Amy, Howard’s getting married, you’re dating my sister."
20927,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,"Now that Howard’s getting married, maybe he’ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you."
20928,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.
20929,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"Eat another pie, you’ll have your own bazongas."
20930,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,That’s cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.
20931,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, please focus. You’re facing a fire-breathing dragon."
20932,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,I don’t know if I want to play anymore.
20933,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"Because you don’t have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons, this game’s in serious trouble."
20934,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Amy,"Now, I assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other’s bikini regions."
20935,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Yeah, my bikini region is fine."
20936,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Amy,"Who’s shocked? I’m not. So, Bernadette, how’s the wedding planning going? And I’m not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. Pick me! Pick me!"
20937,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Bernadette,We went cake-tasting yesterday. Raj came along. He cried and ate half the samples.
20938,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Oh, the poor guy’s so lonely. We should set him up with someone."
20939,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Bernadette,"You know, I met a really cute girl at work. She’s married to a guy in one of our drug trials."
20940,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Well, hello? She’s married."
20941,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Bernadette,"Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me he’s in the placebo group."
20942,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat."
20943,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,Are we ready to order?
20944,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,One moment. I’m conducting an experiment.
20945,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,With Dungeons and Dragons dice?
20946,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"Yes. From here on in, I’ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. Page 14, item seven."
20947,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"So, what’s for dinner?"
20948,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.
20949,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Um, Howard, can I see you for a minute, please?"
20950,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"Uh, I don’t want to show any more of your friends how I can fit in the booster seats."
20951,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Uh, no, that’s not it. Just come with me, please."
20952,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,Let’s see what I’ll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.
20953,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,Do you really want that?
20954,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,That’s the great thing. It doesn’t matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.
20955,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,What’s it thinking about now?
20956,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,Hamburgers and lemonade.
20957,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Um, Raj, there’s someone I want you to meet. This is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin class. Raj, relax. She can’t hear you. She’s deaf."
20958,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"Emily, this is our friend Raj."
20959,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I am so good.
20960,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,Hi.
20961,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,She says it’s nice to meet you.
20962,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?
20963,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"Raj says it’s nice to meet you, too. She says she has to go back to her family, but Penny has her number if you want to text her and get together."
20964,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Okay, I’m going to play it cool. Tell her, maybe. Whatever, babe."
20965,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,He’ll text you.
20966,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Ah, look at that. I have a date. I love America again."
20967,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! That’s what I’m talking about!"
20968,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Okay, as soon as she gets here, so she knows I’m cool with it, I’m going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking, hey, did you hear the one about…? Oh, no, I bet you didn’t."
20969,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.
20970,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Oh, she’s here."
20971,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"No joke. Oh, she says she’s sorry she’s late."
20972,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Tell her it doesn’t matter. Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens."
20973,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,Really? That’s the first thing you want to say?
20974,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,I worked on it all night. Use it.
20975,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"Look, I don’t know the sign for opalescent."
20976,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,Then spell it.
20977,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,I don’t know how to spell it.
20978,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,You’re blowing this for me!
20979,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,He likes your eyes.
20980,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,You’re making me sound like a caveman.
20981,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"She says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.”"
20982,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Really? Ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say, me too."
20983,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,No.
20984,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice like James Earl Jones."
20985,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,She doesn’t know what James Earl Jones sounds like.
20986,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,Great. Then she won’t know I’m lying.
20987,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Let’s see, what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh, I love music. Do you love music?"
20988,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,You really want to ask her that?
20989,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,You’re right. Everyone loves music.
20990,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"She says, do you play an instrument?"
20991,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"No, but when I was six years old, I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn’t get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait, when you sign servants, don’t sign it like I’m bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, that’s right, I had servants."
20992,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,Do you hear yourself
20993,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Yes, but she doesn’t. So get signing, hand monkey."
20994,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day. And then on Christmas morning, under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon."
20995,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,What are you doing?
20996,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,Texting Bernadette that I’m gonna be late.
20997,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Dude, what is she saying?"
20998,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"It’s a funny story about a puppy. Just smile and laugh. Quick, quick, stop smiling."
20999,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,What? Why?
21000,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"The puppy died, it choked on a doll head. Sad face, sad face!"
21001,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"It’s a little hard to see with the city lights, but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda who’s over there."
21002,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"Look, pretty stars. This is her car. She hopes she can see you again sometime."
21003,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Good, good. Oh, boy, help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?"
21004,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"I speak sign language, I don’t read minds."
21005,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"If you were me, would you kiss her?"
21006,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"Yeah, but I’m a make out king."
21007,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,I was so smooth on that date.
21008,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,You? I made you smooth. You were an idiot.
21009,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Whatever, dude. She kissed me."
21010,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"It might’ve been on your lips, but it was my kiss."
21011,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Oh, fine. Let’s agree she kissed both of us."
21012,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,Okay.
21013,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon."
21014,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,Don’t thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave.
21015,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,Why are you still doing this?
21016,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"Because it’s working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I’ve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I’m close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle."
21017,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,"You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants."
21018,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.
21019,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,Is Raj out with Emily again?
21020,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,"Yeah, every night for the last month."
21021,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Wow, can’t believe he has a girlfriend."
21022,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,Me neither.
21023,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,Here’s some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.
21024,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,You’re kidding.
21025,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,You think she’s taking advantage of him?
21026,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Oh, of course not. She wouldn’t do something like that. She’s deaf."
21027,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,Deaf women can’t be gold diggers?
21028,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that."
21029,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion."
21030,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,Could you tell us?
21031,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,Let’s see.
21032,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"Snake eyes. Sorry, bud."
21033,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again."
21034,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"Okay, get this. It doesn’t matter if he’s showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy."
21035,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"What do you mean, vastly wealthy?"
21036,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. I’m not sure what’s tripping you up."
21037,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,"Look, I know they have money. I don’t think it’s that much."
21038,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"No, you’re wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren’t just rich, they’re Richie Rich rich."
21039,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Well, so how much is that?"
21040,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.
21041,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"What the hell? The last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro."
21042,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,"Listen, guys, I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj’s sister, who I love so much. So vastly much."
21043,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Okay, so he’s got money, and it’s a few gifts and a car."
21044,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.
21045,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I could’ve dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I wouldn’t have, because I’m not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj."
21046,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"He’s not going to listen, he’s in love."
21047,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"Can’t figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to…"
21048,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,stay right here.
21049,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"Yeah, this is a bad idea. We should go."
21050,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,No. I’m the one that introduced him to her. I’ve got to say something.
21051,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,Wow.
21052,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,You’re engaged to my friend.
21053,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"Hey, Bernadette doesn’t mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage."
21054,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"I can’t believe you’re engaged to my friend. Oh, here she comes."
21055,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can’t hear you.
21056,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,Hi.
21057,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"Oh, hey, hi. Nice to see you."
21058,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Um, can we talk to you about Raj?"
21059,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"She says, sure, what about him?"
21060,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj is kind of naive. I mean, he hasn’t dated a whole lot of women. And I’m concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I… Howard, focus. Tell her what I’m saying."
21061,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"Right. Are you a gold digger or not? Oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? Mind your own something business and go something yourself. Oh, wait, I got this now."
21062,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,I’m so mad at you!
21063,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Okay, wait…"
21064,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!
21065,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"We didn’t mean for it to be an ambush. Just, it’s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?"
21066,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,I’m hammered.
21067,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Raj, come here. This girl is trouble. I mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?"
21068,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,The best one I ever had!
21069,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Okay, come on. You know you can do better."
21070,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Aha. I see what’s going on here. You and I had our crazy night together, and now you can’t stand to see me with another woman."
21071,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
21072,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,It’s okay. I can’t get mad at your feelings.
21073,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,I don’t have feelings.
21074,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Yeah, that’s good. Keep telling yourself that."
21075,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,He is cuter now that I know he’s rich.
21076,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"I have a surprise for you. Cover your eyes. Open them. It’s a real ruby. It was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love. Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it."
21077,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Oh, Mummy, Daddy. What a nice surprise."
21078,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Dr Koothrappali,"No, it’s not a nice surprise, it’s a bad surprise."
21079,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Mrs Koothrappali,Penny called us.
21080,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,Penny?
21081,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Mrs Koothrappali,She told us you’re spending all our money on your new girlfriend.
21082,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things, too."
21083,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Dr Koothrappali,"Yeah, yeah, I’m a gynaecologist. I know exactly what she gives you."
21084,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Mrs Koothrappali,"You need to find a nice Indian girl from a good family. If you keep seeing this woman, you’re cut off."
21085,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,What? You’re going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?
21086,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Dr Koothrappali,It’s up to you.
21087,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Well, I choose love."
21088,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Dr Koothrappali,"Hah. You’re an idiot. Love doesn’t last. Well, he’s going to find out eventually. Think about it."
21089,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you.
21090,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"No, I think we’ll have to return the car."
21091,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"And that necklace, yeah, that, too. But none of those things matter, because we have something better. We have love."
21092,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad."
21093,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"I know, I know."
21094,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she’s still with me. But I can’t watch the closed captioning without crying.
21095,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Oh, I’m so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better."
21096,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,Seriously? I’m heartbroken and you’re hitting on me?
21097,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,What? No!
21098,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Look, Penny, you’re great, but I had a long talk with my parents, and they said if I date an Indian girl, I get a Maserati."
21099,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Raj,"Mmm. Oh, cheesecake, you’re just as good as a woman, even though I can’t have sex with you."
21100,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.
21101,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home? Come on, papa needs to void his bladder. Oh, that’s not what you want to see after three buttermilks."
21102,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Here you go, boys. I’ll pick it up when you’re ready."
21103,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Howard,"Thanks for dinner, buddy."
21104,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Leonard,"Yeah, real big of you."
21105,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Sheldon,"Hurry, hurry, hurry."
21106,5,4,the wiggly finger catalyst,Penny,"Oh, and don’t cheap out on the tip. We all know you’re loaded now."
21107,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,It’s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?
21108,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"I don’t know. If we’re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I’ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?"
21109,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,What did you have in mind?
21110,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Well, off the top of my head, I’d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England."
21111,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,It would be a replica of a movie prop.
21112,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,Fair enough. It’d give you the right to rule a replica of England.
21113,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"Well, they don’t have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?"
21114,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Mm. Tough decision. There’s no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?"
21115,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Just Bilbo Baggins’ sword over there.
21116,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Two grown men with a hobbit’s dagger; wouldn’t we look silly? Okay, let’s go for it."
21117,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,"Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure."
21118,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"Yeah. It’s okay, I guess."
21119,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,Okay? It’s magnificent.
21120,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?
21121,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,"Oh, it’s hard to put a price on something that’s a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let’s say 250?"
21122,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"Oh, that’s pretty steep."
21123,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,"Well, it’s a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys."
21124,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Only 8,000? We’re wasting precious time. Buy it."
21125,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Hang on. Can you do any better?
21126,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,Are you kidding? I’m already giving you the friends and family discount.
21127,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, did you hear that? We’re getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it."
21128,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Slow down. Two hundred.
21129,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.
21130,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Will you shut up?
21131,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,"Tell you what, I’ll go two thirty-five."
21132,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Nope. Maybe another time.
21133,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,"Okay, two twenty five, my final offer."
21134,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Take it, take it."
21135,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Two hundred.
21136,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,"Man, you’re killing me!"
21137,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,Killing you? I can’t breathe.
21138,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,"Two ten, and I’m losing money."
21139,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, now, we can’t let him lose money, Leonard. I’m so sorry."
21140,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.
21141,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,Are you crazy? That helmet’s signed by Robert Downey Jr.
21142,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,So?
21143,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,"Okay, if you’re going to question the importance of an actor’s signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!"
21144,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten."
21145,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,Thank you. I can eat meat this week.
21146,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,See that? I just saved us forty bucks.
21147,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"I’ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts."
21148,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,You want me to wrap it?
21149,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"No, it’s okay. I’m gonna stab my friend in the chest."
21150,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Will,"Hey, Stuart."
21151,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,"Ah, hey, Wil."
21152,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Hello, Wil Wheaton."
21153,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Wil,"Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword."
21154,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,It’s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?
21155,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Wil,No.
21156,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,I’m not surprised.
21157,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,Here’s the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.
21158,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Wil,Awesome. What do I owe you?
21159,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,Forty bucks.
21160,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Wil,Good deal.
21161,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,Sucker. Didn’t even ask for the friends and family discount.
21162,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Wil,"Hey, I’m having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by."
21163,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,Will there be girls there?
21164,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Wil,"Yeah, of course."
21165,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,‘Cause there wasn’t last time.
21166,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Wil,There will be girls. You guys are invited if you want to come by.
21167,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Thank you.
21168,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Wil,"All right, great. Later."
21169,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"I see what you’re doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we’re going to be there, and when we don’t show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever."
21170,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,I was actually thinking about going.
21171,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it."
21172,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time."
21173,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Stuart,"Oh, great, more guys. It’s gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest."
21174,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"Sheldon, can you grab me a water?"
21175,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,Possibly.
21176,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Can you or can’t you?
21177,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"It’s not that simple, Leonard."
21178,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"It never is, is it?"
21179,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton’s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I’m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger’s Friendship."
21180,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Got it. Can I have my water?
21181,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor."
21182,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Penny,"Wait, what is going on?"
21183,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment…"
21184,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Penny,"No, no, no, no, I didn’t forget. Um, there’s this cat in a box and until you open it, it’s either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother’s camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there."
21185,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Amy,"Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You’re the whole package, aren’t you?"
21186,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"Sorry I’m late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team’s design for the deep field space telescope that’s going on the International Space Station this spring."
21187,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,All,Wow.
21188,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,"Howie, that’s wonderful! Congratulations!"
21189,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is."
21190,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,Mohammed Lee.
21191,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,Who’s Mohammed Lee?
21192,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn’t know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge."
21193,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"It’s me, Sheldon. It’s me. I’m going up in space! Technically, I’m an astronaut."
21194,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,All,"Wow, that’s amazing!"
21195,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,Hang on a second. NASA doesn’t have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?
21196,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"Oh, well, it’s really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market."
21197,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,Are those Russian rockets safe?
21198,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl."
21199,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"I’d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard’s making that a reality. We’re all very proud of you."
21200,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,All,Cheers.
21201,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,That was a lovely toast. Kudos.
21202,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Thank you.
21203,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichs. You sicken me."
21204,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,You’re really quiet. Is everything okay?
21205,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,Fine. Just a little tired.
21206,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"I hope not too tired, because I’m feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift."
21207,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,I always catch your drift.
21208,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"All right, well, something’s obviously bugging you. What is it?"
21209,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,I just can’t believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.
21210,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"Oh, I get it. You’re worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there’s a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home."
21211,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,"Just stop talking, Howard."
21212,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,This isn’t the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.
21213,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,What did you think was going to happen?
21214,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,Honestly? Sex.
21215,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,Howard.
21216,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?
21217,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,"Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We’re supposed to be partners. We’re supposed to be a team."
21218,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"I’m sorry. You’re right. Okay, let’s try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I’d like to discuss it."
21219,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,Okay.
21220,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,I’ve been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?
21221,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,"Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process."
21222,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"Hey, we’re a team. So, what do you think?"
21223,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,No.
21224,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,No?
21225,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,No.
21226,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,Well why not?
21227,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,"Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don’t want to live that way with you."
21228,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again."
21229,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,"Oh, boo-hoo, you’re not going to space!"
21230,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"Pretty cool about Howard, huh?"
21231,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Don’t talk to me as if nothing’s happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy."
21232,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"For God’s sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff."
21233,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?"
21234,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"You never stop talking, do you?"
21235,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Amy,I don’t understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton’s party?
21236,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Penny,Wil Wheaton is Sheldon’s mortal enemy.
21237,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Amy,Mortal enemy?
21238,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Penny,Mm-hmm.
21239,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Amy,"Sheldon, I know you’re a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?"
21240,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?"
21241,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Penny,"Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no."
21242,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This’ll just take a moment. It’s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.
21243,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Amy,A floppy disk?
21244,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Well, I started the list when I was nine."
21245,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Amy,How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?
21246,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,All,"Oh! Oh, God!"
21247,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list."
21248,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,Howard?
21249,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"Change your mind about sex? I’m still mad, but I’ll do it."
21250,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,"No, I’ve just been thinking. It doesn’t matter if I’m afraid for your safety. I don’t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams."
21251,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,Really?
21252,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,"Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it."
21253,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,Thank you.
21254,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,I love you.
21255,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"I love you, too. So, sex now?"
21256,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I’ll be right back.
21257,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Mrs Wolowitz,Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!
21258,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,I’m ready.
21259,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?"
21260,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.
21261,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Raj,Wow. You’re not only our first astronaut. You’re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You’re like a rock star.
21262,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,Little bit.
21263,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you."
21264,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself."
21265,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Going to Wheaton’s party is not betraying you.
21266,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it’s doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you’re looking for."
21267,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,I’m going to a party. I’m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!
21268,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,Not yet.
21269,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Raj,"So, what’s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?"
21270,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"I don’t know. If we’re going to get back together, she’s going to have to apologize and accept that I’m a grown man who can make his own decisions."
21271,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Raj,Then she’s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.
21272,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,Obviously.
21273,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can’t go to space. He’s like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?
21274,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Amy,You’re kidding.
21275,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Penny,"No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book."
21276,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,I don’t know what I’m going to do. I don’t want to break up over this.
21277,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Penny,"Okay, why don’t you just tell him you made a mistake?"
21278,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?
21279,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Amy,It’s not for us to judge. We’re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you’ve done.
21280,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,"Oh, God, you’re right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize."
21281,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Penny,"Well, that, that’s good. I’m glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question."
21282,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,What?
21283,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Penny,Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?
21284,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,"I do, with all my heart."
21285,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Penny,Got it. Just had to check.
21286,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Amy,He’s great.
21287,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"All right, Sheldon, we’re going to Wil’s. This is your last chance."
21288,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you’re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers."
21289,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,You want to drive?
21290,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Raj,Sure.
21291,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon?"
21292,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me."
21293,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party."
21294,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,Brent Spiner?
21295,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Yes.
21296,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,I don’t care.
21297,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him."
21298,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"I did, but I think I’ve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey."
21299,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,"I’m going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon."
21300,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Yeah, even that. You look like a dork."
21301,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Mrs Wolowitz,"Howard, Bernadette’s here!"
21302,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,Tell her I’m not home!
21303,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Mrs Wolowitz,What kind of a schmuck play is that? She can hear you shouting!
21304,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,Can we talk?
21305,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,You can. I have nothing to say.
21306,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,All right. I just wanted to tell you I’m sorry I said something to your mother.
21307,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back."
21308,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,I know. I’m sorry. I got scared.
21309,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"If you’re gonna love me, you’re gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil."
21310,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,I know.
21311,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"Well, don’t say it if you’re not gonna mean it, ’cause I’m not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean."
21312,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.
21313,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"Well, those big kids were rocking it."
21314,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,"I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle."
21315,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,Really?
21316,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Bernadette,You’re my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.
21317,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Howard,"Right, right."
21318,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Mrs Wolowitz,Make up all you want! Your tuchus is not leaving this planet!
21319,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Raj,"Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?"
21320,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Yeah.
21321,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Raj,"Well, I just met her gynaecologist!"
21322,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,What are you doing here?
21323,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you’re still my little buddy. I’m not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let’s meet Brent Spiner and go home."
21324,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Wil,"Hey, Sheldon, I’m so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like."
21325,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,What I’d like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.
21326,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Wil,This is for you.
21327,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
21328,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Wil,"I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn’t show up."
21329,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Wil,Look at what I wrote.
21330,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton."
21331,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Wil,It’s my last one. I want you to have it.
21332,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!"
21333,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Brent Spiner,"Oh, wow. I haven’t seen one of these in years."
21334,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Brent Spiner,Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?
21335,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton."
21336,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Brent,"Sorry, Slim. I’ve got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?"
21337,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"You’ve already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy."
21338,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Wil,Don’t worry. It doesn’t take up a whole lot of your time.
21339,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Sheldon,"Come on, buddy. Let’s not waste another second on this loser. Love your house."
21340,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Can we get autographed dolls?
21341,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Brent,Sure. Twenty bucks.
21342,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Ten.
21343,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Brent,Eighteen.
21344,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Twelve.
21345,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Brent,Sixteen.
21346,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Leonard,Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.
21347,5,5,the russian rocket reaction,Brent,Done.
21348,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,So what kind of cruise is this you’re going on?
21349,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"It’s called the Born Again Boat Ride. Christian Quarterly gave it their highest rating, five thorny crowns. I do wish you’d come with me, Sheldon."
21350,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles."
21351,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"You’re missing out. It’s gonna be wall-to-wall fun. It’s all themed. There’s Jonah and the Whale Watching, all-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet, and my personal favourite, Gunning with God."
21352,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,What’s Gunning with God? I’m afraid to ask.
21353,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, it is a hoot and a half. You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire ’em up in the air, and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun full of our Lord’s forgiveness."
21354,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Frankly, Mom, I’m encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge."
21355,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"For example, if Shelly was aboard, he’d write “smart mouth” on his pigeon, and then bam!"
21356,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken."
21357,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,Sounds delicious.
21358,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Good, ’cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother’s fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin."
21359,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn’t want to cook."
21360,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when she’s too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you.
21361,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Actually, I wouldn’t mind going out for a bite, Sheldon."
21362,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Won’t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you’re going to make me?
21363,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"All right, that settles it, we’re going out. Do you like sushi? There’s a great little place down the street."
21364,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"I’ve never had it, but there’s no harm in trying something new."
21365,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,There’s a lot of harm in trying something new. That’s why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.
21366,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re talking like a crazy person."
21367,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Actually, I had him tested as a child. Doctor says he’s fine."
21368,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Told you.
21369,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Although, I do regret not following up with that specialist in Houston."
21370,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,All,Irasshaimase!
21371,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Stop yelling! I’m not happy about this.
21372,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,What’s the last thing you were ever happy about?
21373,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,The prospect of fried chicken.
21374,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"This is exciting. Back home, the diner on Route Four serves sushi, but it’s just cut up fish sticks and a side of Uncle Ben’s. They put it on the menu in those kung fu letters, but that don’t make it sushi."
21375,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct."
21376,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, I thought the one we couldn’t say was ching chong."
21377,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, that, too."
21378,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"So, Shelly, what’s up with you and your friend Amy, if you don’t mind a mother prying a bit?"
21379,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Well, there’s actually big news on the Amy front. She’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine."
21380,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,Do you have any idea what’s going on with those two?
21381,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"It’s kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there’s something there, maybe there isn’t. We’ll probably never know. But sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it."
21382,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,How are you doing on the young lady front? I hear you’re in some sort of a long distance situation?
21383,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, it’s Raj’s sister. It’s kind of tough. She’s in India. Also, her parents aren’t happy she’s dating someone white."
21384,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, that’s a funny turn, isn’t it? You never think about it going the other way. Well, you can’t force things. You need to figure out if you’re in a relationship or if you’re just calling it one. It’s like they say, a cat can have kittens in the oven but that don’t make ’em biscuits."
21385,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can’tmake your mother fry it."
21386,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken, I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant."
21387,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"Please pester her. Please, for me."
21388,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?"
21389,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"It was good. The only thing that would have made it better is if it was cooked and if it was beef. Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?"
21390,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,I don’t know. Lately we’ve been talking about converting it into a missile silo.
21391,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.
21392,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Get them before they get us.
21393,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Raj,"Hey, look who decided to show up."
21394,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"Raj, what are you doing?"
21395,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Raj,"I couldn’t find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead."
21396,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother."
21397,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Raj,Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.
21398,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Well, it’s so nice to see you, too. I thought it was our Indians that had the occasional alcohol problem."
21399,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"We don’t say that, either. I’ll make you a list."
21400,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, that would be mighty white of you. So, Raj, what pain are you trying to cover up with alcohol?"
21401,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Raj,"Nothing, I’m fine."
21402,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,Are ya?
21403,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Raj,No.
21404,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,That’s better. Now tell me what’s bothering you.
21405,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Raj,I’m so lonely.
21406,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It’s a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you’ll excuse my mother, she’s about to make a pecan pie that’ll be so good I’ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken."
21407,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Sheldon, your friend is hurtin’. What do we do when someone’s hurtin’?"
21408,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Offer them a hot beverage.
21409,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"And when they’re drunk as a skunk, what beverage do we offer?"
21410,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Coffee.
21411,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,And what do we do it with?
21412,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Now you listen to me. I know you feel like you can’t find someone, but there’s a lock for every key. Back home, there’s a girl works at the Wal-Mart. Tall, tall girl. Woman could hunt geese with a rake. Thought she’d never find a man, then one day, wouldn’t ya know, Harlem Globetrotters come to town. Long story short, today that woman travels the world with a semi-professional basketball player and two beautiful mixed-race babies."
21413,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Raj,"I didn’t get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better."
21414,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"I’m not going to get my pecan pie, am I?"
21415,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,You want some Oreos?
21416,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Double Stuf?
21417,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"No, regular."
21418,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Nice. Kick a man when he’s down.
21419,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"I’m glad we’re finally getting to do something together, just the two of us."
21420,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,Sure. One thing you really miss when you’re on vacation is laundry.
21421,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Careful, you’re using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy."
21422,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Well, this takes me back. Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing."
21423,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"It is nice, isn’t it?"
21424,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Penny,Mrs. Cooper. Hi!
21425,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, hello, darlin’."
21426,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Penny,"Sheldon, you didn’t tell me your mom was coming."
21427,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare."
21428,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"So, how’ve you been?"
21429,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Penny,"Good, good."
21430,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend. How are you doing with all that?
21431,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Penny,"Oh, fine. You know, it’s been a while. I’m getting back out there."
21432,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Let me ask you, when you get back out there, are you wearing this?"
21433,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Penny,"Well, it’s super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost."
21434,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures."
21435,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Hon, you think maybe the reason why you’re having trouble finding a guy to settle down with is because you’re letting them ride the roller coaster without buying a ticket?"
21436,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Penny,"Oh, they don’t always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I’m going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I’m going to wear?"
21437,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, not crazy at all. And don’t beat yourself up. When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine."
21438,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Now that will not be in this week’s e-mail blast.
21439,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Howard,"So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station."
21440,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens. If you ever want to live there eternally, I’ve got a good book you could read."
21441,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Howard,"Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year, so I get the gist."
21442,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,I bet your mom is really proud of you.
21443,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Howard,"Nope. She says if I don’t back out she’s going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she’d be in any kind of danger, but still."
21444,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"I’ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I’m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I’ve worked up a couple of Q’s that will stump his sorry A."
21445,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"I don’t know, Shelly. I thought we could do a little sightseeing."
21446,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?
21447,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Come on, Sheldon, we’ll take your mom to see the Hollywood sign, the wax museum, the Walk of Fame."
21448,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Penny,"Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive."
21449,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Well, I can’t spend twelve thousand dollars on a handbag, but it’s free to look upon those who do with righteous condemnation."
21450,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Howard,What do you say?
21451,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom’s visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it."
21452,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Howard,He’s not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.
21453,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,These are delicious.
21454,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,The trick to pancakes is bacon grease. I cook everything in it.
21455,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,Everything? Aren’t you worried about your health?
21456,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, doctors are always changing their mind. One week bacon grease is bad for you. The next week we’re not getting enough of it. Good morning, Shelly."
21457,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night."
21458,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,Apology accepted.
21459,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Great. Now, you’re going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts."
21460,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,I am still going out with your friends.
21461,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn’t do anything wrong.
21462,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls while you were growing up. I want to go sightseeing. So why don’t you have some pancakes, get dressed and come with us."
21463,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"I’m not going, and you can’t make me."
21464,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"You’re right, I can’t. Have a nice day."
21465,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Well, I’m going to stand here until you change your mind."
21466,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Well, then you are going to stand there all day."
21467,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,I’m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.
21468,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,I can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me.
21469,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"I am not abandoning you. Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep. I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan for his service to our country."
21470,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother."
21471,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Well, I guess we are."
21472,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,Sorry. Syrup.
21473,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"All right, Mom. When you’re at the Ripley’s Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world’s most wonderful son, believe it, because it’s true."
21474,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,I hadn’t…
21475,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper.
21476,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Amy,Are you getting sick?
21477,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"No, I’m just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason."
21478,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Amy,"Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn’t making you a priority?"
21479,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh."
21480,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Amy,Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.
21481,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys."
21482,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Amy,"Sheldon, we’re all animals. And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you’re just like everybody else."
21483,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?
21484,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Amy,"Actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better."
21485,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Amy,re you’re not coming down with a cold?
21486,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. You’d love that, wouldn’t you?"
21487,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, this one’s sweet. You know, for your rosary rattlers."
21488,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers."
21489,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"My goodness, it’s a wonder you people in California can talk at all."
21490,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Penny,This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.
21491,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.
21492,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Penny,"Hey, they have wine here, don’t they?"
21493,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Raj,"Hey, none of our gods have abs like that."
21494,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Howard,"Yep, that’s the last Jew who did sit-ups. And look where it got him."
21495,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Hey, while we’re here, why don’t we all do some praying? Let’s put a little church in this church."
21496,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"Oh, I’m not sure we should."
21497,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"It’s easy. I’ll show you how. Lord, Mary Cooper here. Coming to you from Gomorrah, California. I want to thank you for the blessing that is my little Shelly. I also want to thank you for the continued strength not to coldcock him with my Bible. All right, Penny, your turn."
21498,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Penny,"Okay, um, hey, God. What’s up? Um, I’m good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. But no cops. Be cool."
21499,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"She also goes a little overboard on the love thy neighbour. Could probably use that chat you had with Mary Magdalene. Leonard, you’re up. Wasserman, you’re on deck."
21500,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"Okay. I don’t know, it’s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She’s all the way in India. That would be great."
21501,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,Hear that? Girl trouble. Turns out we were both wrong on that front. How about you?
21502,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Howard,"Oh, me? No. Thanks, I’m good. I’m really just trying not to burst into flames."
21503,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,Rajesh?
21504,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Howard,He says he’s having trouble dropping those last five pounds.
21505,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Huh, I might have gone with the talking-to-girls thing."
21506,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Howard,"No, you only get one wish."
21507,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Look at the two of us. Me, a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. You, the common man, tired from your labours as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. But deep down inside, apparently we’re just two peas in a pod. A regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike."
21508,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Smarty-pants.
21509,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Penny,"Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good."
21510,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"You take notes, darlin’. The real way to get a man is with melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup. He’ll die at 50 but his love will be true."
21511,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,I need a tissue.This one got wet.
21512,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,Here.
21513,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Thank you. Yeah, I’ve learned something today. You and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we’re the same."
21514,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Sweetheart, are you sick?"
21515,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"I hope so, because if this is well, life isn’t worth living."
21516,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up. We’ve got to get you to bed."
21517,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Okay.
21518,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,Don’t worry. Mama’s here to take care of her baby.
21519,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people."
21520,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,Of course.
21521,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?
21522,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,You can have whatever you want.
21523,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Thanks, Mom.You’re the best."
21524,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you, you didn’t have hair on your chest."
21525,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"I know, it filled in last year. I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit."
21526,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,And whose fault was that?
21527,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Yours.
21528,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Shelly, you’re not eight years old any more. We have to have a different relationship."
21529,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"No, we don’t. The one we have works great."
21530,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Sweetheart, you are a grown man."
21531,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Or maybe I’m part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I’m still basically a toddler."
21532,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston."
21533,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Does this mean you’re not going to sing Soft Kitty?
21534,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"No, I will always sing you Soft Kitty."
21535,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…"
21536,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Leonard,"Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?"
21537,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,Get out!
21538,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Well, that was rude."
21539,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"Well, I know, but he means well. Sing."
21540,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Happy kitty, sleepy kitty…"
21541,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Sheldon,"What are you trying to pull, Mom? From the top."
21542,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,This is what I’m talking about.
21543,5,6,the rhinitis reaction,Mrs Cooper,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…"
21544,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"And reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero, and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o’clock."
21545,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Ghostly voice,"Sheldon, Sheldon."
21546,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Hmm. All right, all right. I see what’s going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch’s cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clichés. Instead of eek, I say yawn."
21547,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Ghostly voice,Sheldon.
21548,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution."
21549,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma.
21550,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow."
21551,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Raj,You should’ve seen your face.
21552,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Yes, there’s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled."
21553,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Howard,"Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon."
21554,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me."
21555,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Raj,He’s probably right.
21556,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Howard,We can’t beat him. He’s just too smart.
21557,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,Gentlemen.
21558,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Howard,Who had money on faints?
21559,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Raj,I had pee his pants.
21560,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,Hang on. Looks like everyone’s a winner.
21561,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!"
21562,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,Droll.
21563,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Howard,Not as droll as a grown man passed out in a puddle of his own urine.
21564,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.
21565,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you’ve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I’m Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico."
21566,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Stuart,"Hot girl, nine o’clock. Don’t everybody look at once!"
21567,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Raj,What is she doing in a comic book store?
21568,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Stuart,"I don’t know, she might be lost. Doesn’t matter. Watch and learn. Hi."
21569,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Hot girl,Hi.
21570,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Stuart,Um… it-it-it… Shut up.
21571,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Hot girl,Are you getting this Next Men?
21572,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Uh, yeah. It’s issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy."
21573,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Hot girl,I know. I’ve been looking for it for years.
21574,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,Sorry.
21575,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Hot girl,"Hey, if I pretended to hit on you, could I distract you enough to sneak it away?"
21576,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Yes, but you’d be using your superpowers for evil."
21577,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Hot girl,"Damn, I’m forbidden by my Kryptonian father to do so. I am Alice."
21578,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,Leonard.
21579,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,"You are very cute, Leonard."
21580,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it."
21581,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,"No, no. No, no, I, I, I did evil. Would you be open to a trade?"
21582,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess."
21583,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,"Okay. Here. This is my number, call me."
21584,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Sorry, palm’s a little sweaty. What’s that word?"
21585,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,Alice.
21586,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis."
21587,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,Later.
21588,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Howard,Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?
21589,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Stuart,"‘Cause if you did, you get your picture up there on the Wall of Heroes."
21590,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"No, I don’t think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend."
21591,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Stuart,"Doesn’t matter. This is the closest anyone’s ever come. You’re going on the wall, my friend."
21592,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,Be sure to check the mail.
21593,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,How many times are you gonna tell me? What’s with you?
21594,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,Nothing. It’s not suspicious that I’m fixating. It’s consistent with my personality.
21595,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,Right.
21596,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,"Hey, guys."
21597,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,More Halloween candy? Didn’t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?
21598,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,Oh. Yeah. That’s gone. It’s a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.
21599,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Leonard doesn’t have time to chat, he has to get the mail."
21600,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Will you relax? I’ll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?"
21601,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,Open the mail!
21602,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,Excuse me.
21603,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"A couple of circulars, nothing important."
21604,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,What’s with him?
21605,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,Hang on.
21606,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"You might be from Texas, but I’m from New Jersey."
21607,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.
21608,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,What are you wearing?
21609,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Well, you know, it’s Comic Con. I’m Lion-O from ThunderCats."
21610,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,"Wow, you must have gotten so laid."
21611,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.
21612,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,Want to see a comic I draw?
21613,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,You’re kidding. You have your own book?
21614,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,Yeah. It’s kinda based on my life.
21615,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Cool. Oh, look. That’s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?"
21616,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,"You’d think, but no."
21617,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,You’re very talented. This is really good. Did you do…
21618,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,"So, can I trade you my comic for the Hellboy?"
21619,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,You can have my car.
21620,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Oh, dear."
21621,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Oh, dear."
21622,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell."
21623,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Raj,"Good morning, Sheldon."
21624,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"It is, isn’t it? Oh, bother. Isn’t that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you’re out of staples. Gosh, I wish I’d known that earlier today when I was at Staples."
21625,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Raj,You have a thing of paper clips right there.
21626,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?"
21627,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Raj,I don’t know. Maybe.
21628,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,Be a lamb and check.
21629,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Raj,All right.
21630,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Raj,Who do we have here?
21631,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,It’s a snake. A terrifying snake.
21632,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Raj,"Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?"
21633,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,Stop talking like that. You’ve been rendered speechless by fear.
21634,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Raj,Let’s go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.
21635,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You’re better than this."
21636,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,It’s open.
21637,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Hey, you got a minute?"
21638,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,"Yeah, sure, come on in."
21639,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,Thanks.
21640,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,Want some mac and cheese?
21641,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,No. Lactose. Gas.
21642,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,Glass of wine?
21643,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,No. Sulfites. Migraines.
21644,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,"Okay, well, I’d offer you Halloween candy, but that’s gone. So, what’s up?"
21645,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Okay, we used to go out, right?"
21646,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,"Oh, my God, that’s where I know you from."
21647,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"I’m dealing with a situation and it’s kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid."
21648,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,"All right, what’s going on?"
21649,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"So, you’re okay talking about this?"
21650,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,Yes.
21651,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,You’re sure it’s not weird.
21652,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,It’s okay.
21653,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that."
21654,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,"Okay, good, because there’s this one guy I used to date who’s about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn’t get to the point."
21655,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…"
21656,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,"Yeah, probably."
21657,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,Come on.
21658,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,"I’m sorry, go ahead."
21659,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"I met this girl, and she’s great. We have a lot in common."
21660,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,Did you guys do it?
21661,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,No. We just made out a little.
21662,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,"Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?"
21663,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth."
21664,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,That’s gross.
21665,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Here’s the thing, I, I’m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman."
21666,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,"Well, good for you."
21667,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"The problem is, I want to be one of those guys."
21668,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.
21669,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh, that’s not who I am."
21670,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,"All right, then break it off with the new girl."
21671,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Now, let’s not do anything rash. She’s really hot."
21672,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,"If you like this girl so much, why don’t you just end things with Priya?"
21673,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.
21674,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,"Leonard, you’re looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it."
21675,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,Now we’re getting somewhere.
21676,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Penny,What does your gut tell you?
21677,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,Go ask Penny; she’ll know what to do.
21678,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Hello, Howard. I’ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say, job well done."
21679,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,What are you doing?
21680,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,Science. You wouldn’t understand.
21681,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Hey, well, see you. I’m going out."
21682,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,I thought you were leaving the apartment.
21683,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Yeah, me, too. I can’t make up my mind."
21684,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?
21685,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,No. I’m having a moral crisis.
21686,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Well, if it’s of any help, I’ve read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss."
21687,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh, what the hell. I’m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don’t know if I should, because I’m going out with Priya, but she’s in India."
21688,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won’t be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on."
21689,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn’t do more than the stuff that you did, and I’m pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do."
21690,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men."
21691,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,That actually does help.
21692,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,It’s worth noting that he died of syphilis.
21693,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Screw it, I’m going."
21694,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?"
21695,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,Do you mind? I’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
21696,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?
21697,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,No.
21698,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Great. Tropicana, no pulp."
21699,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Howard,"Hey, Sheldon."
21700,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Bernadette,Who is it?
21701,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"It’s me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz."
21702,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Howard,"That’s not my mom, it’s Bernadette."
21703,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,Really? That’s very unsettling.
21704,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Bernadette,"Hi, Sheldon."
21705,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,Hi.
21706,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Howard,What’s up?
21707,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‘er there, you old so-and-so."
21708,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Howard,"Well, I, I’m gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don’t you think it could have waited until then?"
21709,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Holy smoke, why didn’t I think of that? You’re a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put ‘er there, you son of a gun!"
21710,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Howard,Whatever.
21711,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Bernadette,"Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?"
21712,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.
21713,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Bernadette,Howard has a heart condition! You know that!
21714,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Well, I thought he made that up. Isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?"
21715,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Bernadette,"This is adrenaline, we’re gonna have to inject it into his heart."
21716,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,We are?
21717,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Bernadette,"You are. I’m not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we’ve only got one shot."
21718,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Oh, no! I can’t!"
21719,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Bernadette,Hurry! We’re running out of time!
21720,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,Okay.
21721,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Bernadette,Just do it!
21722,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Oh, God! One, two, three!"
21723,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Howard,"Trick or treat, bubbeleh."
21724,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stu…"
21725,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Damn it, I can’t. I can’t, I can’t do this."
21726,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,"Uh, is it my tongue stud? ‘Cause if that freaks you out, you’re in for a real surprise later on."
21727,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"No, no, no. I, I can’t do this. Believe me, I really want to."
21728,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,But?
21729,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,But I kind of have a girlfriend.
21730,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,Are you kidding?
21731,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"You’re cool with you and me just being friends, right?"
21732,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,I don’t believe this.
21733,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Wait, I don’t, which part?"
21734,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Alice,"I’m so stupid. I thought for once I’d met a good guy, but you’re just another jackass."
21735,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I’m gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that’s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That’s kind of my superpower. I’m, like, Captain Good Guy."
21736,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,It’s okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!
21737,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Hey, Priya."
21738,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Priya,"Hey, sweetheart. How’s it going?"
21739,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Uh, not so good. We have to talk."
21740,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Priya,"Oh, sounds serious. What’s up?"
21741,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it’s done, it’s never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry."
21742,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Priya,"Leonard, relax. It’s okay."
21743,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,It is?
21744,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Priya,"Yeah, these things happen. They happen to everybody."
21745,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don’t deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?"
21746,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Priya,"Leonard, I didn’t know if I should tell you, but I kind of cheated on you, too."
21747,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Uh, kind of?"
21748,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Priya,"A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend. So, I guess we both messed up a little."
21749,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot."
21750,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Priya,"Well, it’s not a competition."
21751,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I’m, I’m sorry, I have to go. I don’t believe this."
21752,5,7,the good guy fluctuation,Sheldon,"Bazinga, punk. Now we’re even."
21753,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?"
21754,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,"Well, if you don’t mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great."
21755,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems."
21756,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,Really?
21757,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding."
21758,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,That’s horrible.
21759,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Yes and no. All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. So it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. Check it out, still in the bags. The gowns, not the bridesmaids."
21760,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,I don’t know. Dead people’s dresses?
21761,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"Yeah, and cap sleeves? U-u-uh."
21762,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Uh, I was hoping you wouldn’t notice. Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters."
21763,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"Ladies, please. These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. But through no one’s fault, Penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And again, I’m looking at no one in particular, Penny."
21764,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?"
21765,5,8,the isolation permutation,Howard,"What would you like to talk about, Sheldon? Why do you hate us?"
21766,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,I’ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.
21767,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"Okay, that time you looked at me."
21768,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,Who didn’t? Your skin is like alabaster. Do you even have pores?
21769,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN, paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse."
21770,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"All right, who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?"
21771,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,"Oh, me."
21772,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"Through no one’s fault, Sheldon, we’re leaving."
21773,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,Wait for moi.
21774,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,You’re leaving?
21775,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I’m a lady. And with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body."
21776,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"Ah. New topic. Women, delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?"
21777,5,8,the isolation permutation,Raj,"Totally. What’s wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the right figure for it, they’re adorabl"
21778,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?"
21779,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
21780,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.
21781,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"It’s hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it."
21782,5,8,the isolation permutation,Howard,That’s fun to have in a lunchroom.
21783,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you’re going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little mother who’s been biting you all week."
21784,5,8,the isolation permutation,Howard,"Please, we’re eating. Can we get that off the table and change the subject?"
21785,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.
21786,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"This time, it’s your fault."
21787,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it’s just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep."
21788,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?"
21789,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"I don’t know, four or five years."
21790,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"No, it’s not gonna do it."
21791,5,8,the isolation permutation,Howard,Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.
21792,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,They’re out shopping right now?
21793,5,8,the isolation permutation,Howard,Yeah.
21794,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,Just the two of them?
21795,5,8,the isolation permutation,Howard,I guess.
21796,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"That’s cool, that’s cool."
21797,5,8,the isolation permutation,Howard,Why are they asking me about this stuff? What guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is?
21798,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"Leonard’s coming down the home stretch! Come on, horsey, you can do this! Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if I weren’t too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon, you’re up."
21799,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,What?
21800,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"Come on, it’s your turn. We said we’d get more fresh air."
21801,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"Sorry. I’m a little distracted. I can’t seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing."
21802,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,Did you try calling her on the telephone?
21803,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser."
21804,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"If you’re worried, we can go over there and see if she’s all right."
21805,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood."
21806,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,I don’t think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.
21807,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?
21808,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,You do?
21809,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, I’m worried Amy’s been eaten by a bobcat."
21810,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,Forget about the bobcat.
21811,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,How can I? You won’t stop talking about it.
21812,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. Everybody hurts, sometimes."
21813,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,She sounds weepy. I don’t like weepy. Let’s go.
21814,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"Uh, she’s your friend. Step up."
21815,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,Where are you going?
21816,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"I’m single, I don’t need this crap."
21817,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
21818,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,You didn’t respond to any of my electronic communications.
21819,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,I wanted to be alone.
21820,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.
21821,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me."
21822,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"Point of order. As you’re in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I’m a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?"
21823,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters.
21824,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"If you’d like to take your mind off what’s troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted."
21825,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.
21826,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,And that made you feel sad?
21827,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,Yes.
21828,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I’m good at this."
21829,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"It’s just, I thought they liked hanging out with me, but I guess I was fooling myself."
21830,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"When they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? ‘Cause I can see how that could stick in someone’s craw."
21831,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Sheldon, I’m going to ask you something, and I’d like you to keep an open mind."
21832,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,Always.
21833,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact."
21834,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"Oh, boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind."
21835,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,Proposal. One wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.
21836,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who’s a good Amy."
21837,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"How about this? French kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base."
21838,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"Neck massage, then you get me that beverage."
21839,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,We cuddle. Final offer.
21840,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"Very well. Oh, boy."
21841,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"I’m just saying, second base is right there."
21842,5,8,the isolation permutation,Raj,"Mm, I’m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation, like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache."
21843,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?
21844,5,8,the isolation permutation,Raj,This is not a safe place. You can’t share anything here.
21845,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,The two of you need to get your women in line!
21846,5,8,the isolation permutation,Howard,What?
21847,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time."
21848,5,8,the isolation permutation,Howard,What do you want us to do about it?
21849,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"You clearly weren’t listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someone’s snuggle bunny!"
21850,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,Why do I have to talk to Penny? She’s not my girlfriend.
21851,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you, you make it so!"
21852,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,Moo-shu is Penny.
21853,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,Thank you. Where’s Sheldon?
21854,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed."
21855,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,That’s so sweet.
21856,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"Yeah, but now he’s gonna be up at dawn and want to play."
21857,5,8,the isolation permutation,Howard,"So, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of Amy. She’s kind of upset."
21858,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,Why?
21859,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.
21860,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,I told you that would happen.
21861,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she’s just getting a little crazy with it."
21862,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,"She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and they’re all about getting naked and washing each other."
21863,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"Yeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the Three Menstra-teers"
21864,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,We thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her. I feel terrible.
21865,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"I know. Me, too. We’ll talk to her. Hey, wait, how did she find out?"
21866,5,8,the isolation permutation,Howard,"Raj did it. And he says he would do it again. Okay, I’m sorry. You sent me the picture, I wasn’t thinking."
21867,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,"Oh, Howie."
21868,5,8,the isolation permutation,Howard,"Well, hey, I’m usually pretty good at not blabbing. You tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and I never repeat it."
21869,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,What do you tell him?
21870,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,"Oh, you know, just pillow talk. You guys have nothing to worry about."
21871,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?"
21872,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,No. All your little secrets are fine.
21873,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,"Yes, absolutely fine."
21874,5,8,the isolation permutation,Howard,I’ll tell you later.
21875,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Come on, tumour. Come on, tumour, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma. Yay, brain tumour! Probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news."
21876,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,Hi.
21877,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,Hello.
21878,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,What are you doing here?
21879,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"Well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day."
21880,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"That’s not necessary, it’s like Sesame Street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone."
21881,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"Look, come on, Amy, look, let us make it up to you. We’ll have a girl’s night, we’ll do whatever you want."
21882,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,We can go down to the Korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other.
21883,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"With-with loofah mitts, no hands."
21884,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,It’s okay. I’m glad this happened. I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-
21885,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,the-right-light friend want to hang out with me.
21886,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,"Amy, we’re really sorry."
21887,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"Yeah, we feel awful."
21888,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Don’t. I’ll be okay. You’re not the first girls I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me. It’s like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in Norway all over again."
21889,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"Oh, come on, Amy."
21890,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,You don’t get it. Look at this brain.
21891,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,I don’t really want to.
21892,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"This is us. Bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere. Penny, you’re the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere. And where’s Amy? She’s right here, the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with."
21893,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,"Amy, you’re not a tumour. Penny, tell her she’s not a tumour."
21894,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? Ahoy. I like it. Amy? Is that you? Have you been drinking? I’m sorry, I bet my sweet what? Well, all right. We’re on our way."
21895,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,What’s going on?
21896,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.
21897,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,Really? Amy?
21898,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"Leonard, be glad you can’t keep a woman. They are a handful."
21899,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Oh, look. It’s Sheldon and little Leonard. Hi, little Leonard."
21900,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"Hi, Amy."
21901,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Hey, Cuddles."
21902,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,Cuddles?
21903,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard."
21904,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"Amy, what are you doing here?"
21905,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Well, I came here to get a bottle of wine like Penny taught me to do when you’re sad."
21906,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"Yeah, but why didn’t you go back to your apartment?"
21907,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Didn’t you go to high school, Leonard? Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. Not that the rat bastards ever invited me."
21908,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,Maybe we should get you home.
21909,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon, what would it take for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch, take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with me?"
21910,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,"Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?"
21911,5,8,the isolation permutation,Sheldon,"I’m begging both of you, please, let’s go."
21912,5,8,the isolation permutation,Leonard,Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.
21913,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Whee! Ooh, finally someone found second base."
21914,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"I know how you feel. I got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too."
21915,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,Hi.
21916,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,What do you want? Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?
21917,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,I never gave you a friendship bracelet.
21918,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me. You can have it back if you want."
21919,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"No, you made that for you, I want you to have it."
21920,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,"We know you’re upset, and you have every right to be, but if it’s okay with you, we’d like a second chance to make things right."
21921,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"We are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you."
21922,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,Which is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding.
21923,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke? Like in Norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?"
21924,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,"No. I, I want you to be the maid of honour."
21925,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Oh, my gosh. No one’s every asked me to be the maid of honour before. Well, that’s not true. Once, but then they all died."
21926,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,So is that a yes?
21927,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Yes. Yes. Oh, my gosh, I, I have so much to do. There’s the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. What should we do for the bachelorette party? Oh, I know, we’ll go to a Native American sweat lodge, we’ll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette’s naked body. So that’s happening."
21928,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun, too."
21929,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"I feel like crying. Of course, I could just be hormonal. Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette? No? Penny?"
21930,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,Sorry.
21931,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,Really?
21932,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"Okay, yeah."
21933,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,Yay!
21934,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Maid of honour Amy Farrah Fowler’s amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one."
21935,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,"We’re just trying on dresses, do we really need to record this?"
21936,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"I’m sorry, are you the maid of honour?"
21937,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,I am the bride.
21938,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,So no. And action.
21939,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,What do you think?
21940,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,I love it!
21941,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"What are you, a nun? Come on, bestie, let’s see some skin."
21942,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,"Oh, Amy! Looking sexy!"
21943,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,You think they don’t have mirrors in there? I know how I look.
21944,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"Oh! Bernadette, you look beautiful!"
21945,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,You do.
21946,5,8,the isolation permutation,Bernadette,Thank you.
21947,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful."
21948,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"Come on, bestie, you’re up."
21949,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,Give me a minute.
21950,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,What is taking you so long?
21951,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!"
21952,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,"– Sorry, sorry."
21953,5,8,the isolation permutation,Penny,"Oh, God. Amy!"
21954,5,8,the isolation permutation,Amy,Sorry.
21955,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,Hey.
21956,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?"
21957,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,Yeah. I’ve got eight pounds of salmon that’s about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?
21958,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Not really.
21959,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?
21960,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Star Wars on Blu-ray.
21961,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Haven’t you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?"
21962,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.
21963,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Oh, Leonard."
21964,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"I know, it’s high-resolution sadness."
21965,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Well, I’m going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?"
21966,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Really? Do we do that?
21967,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,What do you mean?
21968,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"You know, we haven’t spent time alone together since we broke up."
21969,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Oh, it’s not a date, Leonard. It’s just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night."
21970,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Sounds like most of my dates.
21971,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!"
21972,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,What is that about?
21973,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Well, he’s smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster."
21974,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"Shoo, shoo! Be gone!"
21975,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,What the hell is going on?
21976,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"There’s a bird outside the window, and he won’t go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo."
21977,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Really? On top of everything else, you’re afraid of birds?"
21978,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"It’s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets."
21979,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"So movies, yes or no?"
21980,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Movies, yes."
21981,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Great. I’ll see you later. And remember, he’s more afraid of you than you are of him."
21982,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,That doesn’t help.
21983,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"No, I was talking to the bird."
21984,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"Go away, bird. Go away, bird. Go away, bird."
21985,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Sheldon, just ignore him."
21986,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,Good idea. Attention is what birds want.
21987,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"Oh, much better. All right. Now I’ll just get along with my life."
21988,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It’s going to be a long night."
21989,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,The bird’s still there?
21990,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"Quick, what does a hawk sound like?"
21991,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,I don’t know. Scree-scree.
21992,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"Please, that’s a seagull. If you’re not going to help, don’t help."
21993,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Sorry. Do you think I’m overdressed?
21994,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you’re playing Vegas, I’d add sequins."
21995,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,I’m going to the movies with Penny. I don’t want her to think that I think it’s a date.
21996,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,Do you think it’s a date?
21997,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"No, but she might think I think it’s a date even though I don’t."
21998,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,Or you might think she thinks you think it’s a date even though she doesn’t.
21999,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Are we overthinking this?
22000,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,Not at all.
22001,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,You’re right. I’m fine. I’m wearing this.
22002,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,Really? A blazer? All right.
22003,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I’d like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I’m sorry, this is Animal Control. I don’t understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you’re frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you’re stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don’t you think I tried making cat noises?"
22004,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Too casual?
22005,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great."
22006,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,What am I thinking? Whiskers!
22007,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie."
22008,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Oh, yeah, sure. There’s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America."
22009,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she’s not building a dam."
22010,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Can’t argue with that. I’ll get the tickets.
22011,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,Okay.
22012,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Actually, you know what? I think it’s about time I pick a movie we see."
22013,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,You pick plenty of movies.
22014,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along."
22015,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes."
22016,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,I hate those movies.
22017,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"No, you don’t."
22018,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can’t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused."
22019,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?"
22020,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,All the time.
22021,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,You’re kidding.
22022,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Does this sound familiar? I’d love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It’s great. It’s two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn’t?"
22023,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway."
22024,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?
22025,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,No. No woman would.
22026,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"See? Now, that’s the great thing. We’re out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let’s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert."
22027,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"All right, fine."
22028,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.
22029,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Raj,"Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars."
22030,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Howard,I’m pushing play.
22031,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,A minute.
22032,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Howard,"If we don’t start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again."
22033,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.
22034,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Howard,I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.
22035,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"Yeah, but you’ve got a can-do attitude and that’s what’s important."
22036,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Raj,I really don’t get your problem with birds.
22037,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup."
22038,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Raj,Hummingbirds are pretty.
22039,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.
22040,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Raj,"Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth."
22041,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?"
22042,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Raj,"Yes, please. This is way better than the movie."
22043,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Howard,"All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready."
22044,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"It’s not a death ray. It’s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn’t be living here. I’d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one."
22045,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Raj,That is one tough birdie.
22046,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate."
22047,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can’t."
22048,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,I’m going to get some fries. You want anything?
22049,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Uh, no, thanks."
22050,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries."
22051,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,I just eat the little crispy ones you don’t like.
22052,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they’re gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?"
22053,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,To get sex.
22054,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?"
22055,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"All right, I’d like an order of fries."
22056,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Great. That’ll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I’m so glad you suggested we do this.
22057,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Oh, sorry."
22058,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Man,No problem.
22059,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,What you writing there?
22060,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Man,A screenplay. Its about a guy whose roommate is having sex and tells him go to a bar and work on his screenplay.
22061,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,I Hope Alex Gets Crabs
22062,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Man,It’s a working title.
22063,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,Oh.
22064,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Man,I’m Kevin.
22065,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.
22066,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Kevin,I’ll let you get back to your date.
22067,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Oh, no, no. This isn’t a date, no. Right?"
22068,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Uh, right."
22069,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,So have you written anything I might have seen?
22070,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Kevin,That depends. How much time do you spend on Yelp?
22071,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,This is ridiculous. I’m a grown man from Texas. This isn’t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It’s just a blue jay.
22072,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,That’s a pretty big blue jay.
22073,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"One, two, three."
22074,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"o! Shoo! Am-scray, ird-bay!"
22075,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,Bird in the apartment! Bird in the apartment!
22076,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,No!
22077,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"So it is an amazing documentary. They need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment."
22078,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"You’re kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?"
22079,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?"
22080,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Kevin,No problem.
22081,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,What’s up?
22082,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,I know what you’re doing.
22083,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,What am I doing?
22084,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,You’re going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren’t on a date.
22085,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"No, I’m talking to him because he’s cute."
22086,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Come on, he’s not that cute."
22087,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses."
22088,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.
22089,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Yes, but when you’re tall and have great cheekbones, you’re doing it ironically."
22090,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"If that’s so, what if I start talking to a girl?"
22091,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,You should.
22092,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,I’m serious. I’ll do it.
22093,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?
22094,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,They’re in a group. I’m scared.
22095,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Amy,"Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?"
22096,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"You’re biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That’s a living thing, get cracking."
22097,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Bernadette,"I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains."
22098,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Amy,"Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing."
22099,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class."
22100,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Bernadette,"Come back in, Sheldon, he’s not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someone’s pet."
22101,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"No, Bernadette, don’t be a hero!"
22102,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Bernadette,"Oh, he’s a sweetie."
22103,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"Yes. It’s very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet."
22104,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Amy,"Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman."
22105,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I’m not going to be another statistic.
22106,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Bernadette,"Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi. Come on. You can do it. Don’t be scared. Come on. Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!"
22107,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him."
22108,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Woman,"So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?"
22109,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Um, let’s see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie."
22110,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,Hey. Sorry I ditched you.
22111,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"No, it’s fine. You can ditch away."
22112,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, let’s hang out."
22113,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,It’s cool. Go back to Kevin.
22114,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Oh, he had to leave."
22115,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Interesting. So now that he’s gone, you want to hang out with me."
22116,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Woman,This must be Penny.
22117,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Yep.
22118,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Woman,I totally get it.
22119,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Huh? I’m sorry, get what?"
22120,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Don’t worry about it. You know, there’s some guys over there. You should go talk to them."
22121,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"No, no. I want to know what you told her."
22122,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,That’s kind of between me and…
22123,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Woman,Laura.
22124,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Laura.
22125,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?"
22126,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Laura,Really?
22127,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.
22128,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Hey, pal. You didn’t see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter."
22129,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Okay. Then I’ll return the favour, and I won’t tell…"
22130,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Laura,Laura.
22131,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.
22132,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?"
22133,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?
22134,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Oh, yeah? Spell asthma."
22135,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,A… S… Take me home.
22136,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Maybe I’m not done hanging out with…
22137,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"You’re right, it’s getting late."
22138,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"It’s remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He’s magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven’t offered you a beverage."
22139,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Bernadette,"Oh, it’s just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control."
22140,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"My phone’s on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, I’d call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn’t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You’re just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren’t you?"
22141,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Amy,Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.
22142,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Bernadette,I still think he looks like someone’s pet. Maybe we should put up posters.
22143,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We’re going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite."
22144,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Amy,"If you’re keeping him, I’ve got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical."
22145,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn’t sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I’m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn’t that right, LD?"
22146,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He’s gone."
22147,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Amy,"I’m sorry, Sheldon."
22148,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,"How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!"
22149,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night."
22150,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Okay, I’m not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass."
22151,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I’m sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it’s not like when we were going out, I’d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I’m sorry."
22152,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"All right. Thank you. I’m sorry, too."
22153,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?"
22154,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,Way off.
22155,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Maybe we’re not ready to hang out as friends.
22156,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"I don’t know. Up until the last part, I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky."
22157,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,Really?
22158,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,Yeah.
22159,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"Well, then, I’m putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?"
22160,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,Ooh. Maybe I like it.
22161,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,"You do? Because if that’s what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I’ll be anything you want me to be."
22162,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Penny,"Good night, Leonard."
22163,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Leonard,I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.
22164,5,9,the ornithophobia diffusion,Sheldon,Mine was great. I’m going to be a mommy.
22165,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,It’s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.
22166,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,"It’s probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets."
22167,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,"Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay."
22168,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?"
22169,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,"Sheldon, I’m disappointed. As a brilliant man, you’re entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o."
22170,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that’s cool."
22171,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Stuart,Can I help you find anything?
22172,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can’t be used as a floatation device.
22173,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Stuart,Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. Couple of them have big boobs.
22174,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Raj,"Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka’a expansion pack is out."
22175,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,"A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It’s like a secret tax on guys who can’t get laid."
22176,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Raj,"They’re not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why, absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?"
22177,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?
22178,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Raj,A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.
22179,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,"Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid’s cowboy hat?"
22180,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,"What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we’re talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka’a?"
22181,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Stuart,"Leonard, what’s the deal with Sheldon’s friend Amy? Are they a couple?"
22182,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,Couple of weirdos. Why?
22183,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,You interested in Amy?
22184,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Stuart,"Well, I mean, she didn’t look through me with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling hatred and contempt. I like that in a woman. Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?"
22185,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,Sure. I guess.
22186,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Raj,"Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?"
22187,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Stuart,"If I tell you that, I’m robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical, rootin’ tootin’ low price of $24.95."
22188,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Raj,I’ll take one.
22189,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,"Mmm, make it two."
22190,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,I hate all of you and myself. Three.
22191,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Stuart,I’ll ring it up. Like shooting nerds in a barrel.
22192,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Scene,The apartment.
22193,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,"Hey, can I talk to you about something? It’s a little awkward."
22194,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you’re at, you’re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don’t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that."
22195,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,"Yeah, that’s not it. Stuart’s kind of interested in Amy."
22196,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Oh, of course he is. She’s very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?"
22197,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,No. He wanted me to find out if you’d have a problem with him asking her out.
22198,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"I’m not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don’t own Amy. Can’t own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you’re going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you’ll have to know."
22199,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,You know what? Never mind. I’m going to tell him it’s okay to ask her out.
22200,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia."
22201,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,"All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you’d feel about it."
22202,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist."
22203,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,I am not washed-up.
22204,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can’t until you admit the problem."
22205,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,"Well, ladies, we killed the bottle."
22206,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,I had half a glass.
22207,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Bernadette,I didn’t have any.
22208,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,"Okay, don’t judge me. So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?"
22209,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,Or we play Travel Twister.
22210,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Bernadette,"Amy, really? Twister?"
22211,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,"Excuse me. I’ve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. And I’m sure it’s a lot more exciting when you play with other people. What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins. I’m shirts. Called it."
22212,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Bernadette,"I’m too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom."
22213,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,"Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God."
22214,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,"Guys, something happened."
22215,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,What’s wrong?
22216,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,I think a boy likes me.
22217,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Bernadette,Hi. It’s Stuart. We met at the comic book store. I was wondering if you’d like to get coffee sometime. It’s okay if you say no. It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft.
22218,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,"Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester."
22219,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Bernadette,What are you going to do? Doesn’t he know you have a boyfriend?
22220,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,"Oh, she doesn’t have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?"
22221,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,"I don’t know. He’s nice. He’s funny. He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. That’s kind of hot."
22222,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,"Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you’ve been with him over a year now. If it’s not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?"
22223,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Bernadette,"Well, yeah, I guess they’re not engaged like me and Howie."
22224,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,"Yeah, for what it’s worth, engaged people can look around, too. Lot of options out there."
22225,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,Where’s Stuart?
22226,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Speccy Guy Behind Counter,Out.
22227,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,Who are you?
22228,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Speccy Guy,I’m Dale. He left me in charge.
22229,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,Really?
22230,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Dale,"Yeah. I don’t get it, either."
22231,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka’a expansion pack.
22232,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Dale,Sorry. I don’t do returns. They’re hard.
22233,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,"Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?"
22234,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Dale,I don’t know. He went out for coffee. With a girl.
22235,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Oh, I guess I was wrong."
22236,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,You okay?
22237,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Am I okay? Leonard, I’m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?"
22238,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Dale,"I’m okay, too!"
22239,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Raj,Wild Bill Witchcock.
22240,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,A tribe of Abra-Comanches.
22241,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I’m very disappointed in you cowpokes. We’re playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I’m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion."
22242,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,"We’re not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous."
22243,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?"
22244,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,Yeah.
22245,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,Very.
22246,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Raj,Incredibly so.
22247,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?
22248,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,Yeah.
22249,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,Very.
22250,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Raj,Incredibly so.
22251,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"All right, fine. Let’s just play."
22252,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,We should go easy on him. Amy’s out with Stuart tonight.
22253,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon’s patented blend of condescension and no sex isn’t enough to hold on to a woman?
22254,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Cluck, cluck, cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?"
22255,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,Sorry. Creepy Tepee.
22256,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Raj,Annie Ogly.
22257,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.
22258,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who’s really being ridiculous here."
22259,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,It’s you.
22260,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,You are.
22261,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Raj,Totally you.
22262,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Raj,"Hey, guys, check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector’s tin."
22263,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,"Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack."
22264,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,"Ooh, a sheriff’s badge."
22265,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Raj,"Yeah, it’s also a wand."
22266,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,"With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?"
22267,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"I’m in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything."
22268,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,You’ve got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?
22269,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,I thought you didn’t like Facebook anymore.
22270,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,Don’t be silly. I’m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.
22271,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Raj,Please. You’re looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.
22272,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?"
22273,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Raj,You’re so full of it.
22274,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.
22275,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Raj,You unfriended me? Seriously?
22276,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,"Oh, yeah. Now he’s gonna miss all those great updates like, I can’t believe I waited this long to make my own potpourri."
22277,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,"Sheldon, why don’t you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don’t want her going out with other men?"
22278,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.
22279,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Howard,"Here’s a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed."
22280,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.
22281,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,That’s all of us. Can I use the laptop?
22282,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,Why?
22283,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Leonard,I have to buy that stupid collector’s tin.
22284,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,Who do we love?
22285,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,Penny.
22286,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,Who do we love?
22287,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,Penny.
22288,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,Who do we love?
22289,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,Penny.
22290,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,"Hello, Sheldon. Come on in."
22291,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,Thank you.
22292,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,What’s up?
22293,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.
22294,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,"I’m sorry, what?"
22295,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps you’d like to take in a prizefight."
22296,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,"God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?"
22297,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.
22298,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,"Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back."
22299,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?"
22300,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,"All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where I’m going with this?"
22301,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,I believe I do.
22302,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,Mm.
22303,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,I’m the guy.
22304,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,You’re not the guy.
22305,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time."
22306,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,I call everyone sweetie.
22307,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,You tramp.
22308,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,"Look, Sheldon, all I’m saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy."
22309,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?"
22310,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,"Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy."
22311,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Stuart,"If you’re bored, you can go. I understand."
22312,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,"No, I’m having a nice time."
22313,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Stuart,Don’t patronize me.
22314,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi, Stuart."
22315,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Stuart,"Hi, Sheldon."
22316,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,Pardon me. Excuse me.
22317,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
22318,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence, Stuart."
22319,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Stuart,"None taken. Although repellent is kind of a, kind of a strong word."
22320,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,"I’m sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want."
22321,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Stuart,"Um, again…"
22322,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Stuart, please. You’re being rude."
22323,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,Anything else?
22324,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.
22325,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,I’m listening.
22326,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend."
22327,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative.
22328,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,You’re being impossible.
22329,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,"Hi, Stuart."
22330,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?"
22331,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,Yes.
22332,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Well, that’s enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here’s a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids."
22333,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Stuart,"So, other than you taking your relationship to the next level with another guy, this was nice."
22334,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,"Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door."
22335,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Stuart,"Oh, you’re welcome."
22336,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,Amy. Amy. Amy. Let’s wrap things up out there.
22337,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,"Um, good night, Stuart."
22338,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Stuart,Good night.
22339,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,nan,"Take the hint, Stuart. The lady said good night."
22340,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,How did you get into my apartment?
22341,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you’re my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.
22342,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,What’s that?
22343,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend."
22344,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,It’s so romantic.
22345,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,Mutual indemnification always is. Why don’t you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.
22346,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,Section 5
22347,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,Feel free to retain a lawyer.
22348,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,"Penny, I said right hand red."
22349,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,"Yeah, I heard you. I got red."
22350,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,"Bernadette, left foot yellow."
22351,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Bernadette,We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo.
22352,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,Penny. Amy. Bernadette
22353,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,That’s my boyfriend. It’s open!
22354,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,I got a splinter.
22355,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,What do you want me to do about it?
22356,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Sheldon,"Relationship agreement Section 4, Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it."
22357,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Amy,I should’ve gotten a lawyer.
22358,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Bernadette,Looks like it’s just us playing. Penny?
22359,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Bernadette,"Penny, we’re out of wine!"
22360,5,10,the flaming spittoon acquisition,Penny,You should probably drive.
22361,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?
22362,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s “Penny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.” No spaces."
22363,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Okay. If you can’t get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?"
22364,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,I believe that you’re capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day.
22365,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,You want to hear something weird?
22366,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,Sure.
22367,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter."
22368,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,What are you talking about?
22369,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.
22370,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her."
22371,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,Oh. I thought it was a game.
22372,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,What’s yours?
22373,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"There’s this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He’s in town and wants to have drinks."
22374,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick."
22375,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Just do it, ’cause he’s not gonna let it go."
22376,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,Basketball Pope.
22377,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,And that’s how it’s done.
22378,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?
22379,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,I don’t know.
22380,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?
22381,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"No, that was a different guy."
22382,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?"
22383,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"No, that was a different, different guy."
22384,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?
22385,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,No.
22386,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?"
22387,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"No, but, actually, that was this guy’s sister."
22388,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"All right, well, what do you think he wants?"
22389,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,I don’t know.
22390,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there."
22391,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,I told you. That was a different guy.
22392,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,Hmm. That’s too bad. We could have spent New Year’s Eve waiting for the ball to drop.
22393,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,It’s two a.m. What are you doing up?
22394,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.
22395,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.
22396,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"Look at these men. They’ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there."
22397,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,Thanks.
22398,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"So, what’s got you up? Did you have a bad clam?"
22399,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,I didn’t have clams.
22400,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,I don’t watch you 24 hours a day. I don’t know what you do.
22401,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"It’s this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can’t decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces."
22402,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What’s the matter, Saul? You afraid someone’s going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein’s cosmological constant?"
22403,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I’m gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I’m hitting myself.”"
22404,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, now Perlmutter’s shaking the King’s hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it."
22405,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,I love this dress. How come I never see you wear it?
22406,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"‘Cause when I wear it, it’s a shirt. So, what’s Howard doing tonight?"
22407,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,"Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully."
22408,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes."
22409,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,"When Leonard gets back, I’d love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think he’d let me draw a syringe full of his blood?"
22410,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Hmm, he’s not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it’ll just pour out of his nose."
22411,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,"I don’t think I can meet the girl who was always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time while I was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker."
22412,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Oh, that’s awful."
22413,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,"Worst part was, it was too big."
22414,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,"That’s nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler."
22415,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,Wow. You poor thing.
22416,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,What about you?
22417,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,Oh. I don’t know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn’t really have bullies.
22418,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,"Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?"
22419,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"No, we weren’t really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight."
22420,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,"Oh, my God, that’s awful."
22421,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"No, it was funny. Everyone laughed."
22422,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,Did Kathy Geiger laugh?
22423,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Uh, probably. It’s hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth."
22424,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?
22425,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,What? I was not a bully.
22426,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon.
22427,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,Shh. That’s how you wind up in a cornfield.
22428,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Raj,Is that him over there?
22429,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,No.
22430,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Raj,How about that guy? He looks like he’d hate you.
22431,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"You know, I can really do this by myself."
22432,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Howard,"Hey, we’re here to support you, buddy."
22433,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"No, you’re not. You’re here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head."
22434,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Howard,You wore underwear? You fool.
22435,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Raj,"So, have you figured out what you’re going to say to him?"
22436,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.
22437,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Howard,"That’s quite a list. I can’t read your handwriting, what’s that word?"
22438,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,Scrotum.
22439,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Raj,What’s that one?
22440,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Uh, stapled."
22441,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,Leonard.
22442,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Oh, hi."
22443,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"Holy crap, man, it’s good to see you."
22444,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard."
22445,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"Hi. Fellas. Hey, can I get a beer? Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard Hofstadter. I hear you’re a big-time scientist now."
22446,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,And there’s the first zinger. Ouch.
22447,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"I’m doing okay, I guess."
22448,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"Okay? Come on, I read online you’re a physicist at a university, you won some medal."
22449,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,The Newcomb medal.
22450,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"Yeah, congratulations."
22451,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. That’s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework."
22452,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"From what I read, it sounded like a big deal."
22453,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?"
22454,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Raj,"Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too."
22455,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,My point.
22456,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"You should have seen this guy back in the day. Huh? He was so little, he could fit in just about anywhere. Lockers, trash cans. Oh, man, how did you get inside that backpack?"
22457,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Oh, I can’t take all the credit. You helped a lot."
22458,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,Yeah. We were practically a comedy team.
22459,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Howard,Like the Black Death and Europe.
22460,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Jimmy, I’m kind of curious why you wanted to see me."
22461,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"Okay, here it is. I have this great money-making idea. I just need a gear head to get it to the finish line."
22462,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"Technically, Howard’s the gear head. Leonard’s just a dime store laser jockey."
22463,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,What’s the idea?
22464,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"This is just between us, right?"
22465,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,Right.
22466,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,Okay. What do you think about a pair of glasses that makes any movie you want into 3D?
22467,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Raj,"That sounds amazing. First movie I’m watching, Annie."
22468,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Howard,How exactly would these glasses work?
22469,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,How the hell should I know? That’s why I need a nerd.
22470,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,I don’t think something like that’s even possible.
22471,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"Aw, come on, you can figure it out. You’re like the smartest guy I’ve ever known."
22472,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you can’t live in fear of this man forever."
22473,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Sheldon, I got this."
22474,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"You clearly don’t. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you’re a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity."
22475,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,Sheldon.
22476,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you’re a mess."
22477,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,I don’t understand.
22478,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,I think what he’s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.
22479,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey’s Kisses to your nipples.
22480,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Raj,That’s funny because those aren’t the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.
22481,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,What is that?
22482,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.
22483,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind."
22484,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,What’s this word?
22485,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.
22486,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,You really need to work on your penmanship.
22487,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"Oh, man, I, I don’t know what to say. I always thought we were just having some fun."
22488,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,It wasn’t fun for me.
22489,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"You’re being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him."
22490,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Come on, guys."
22491,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Raj,"That was pretty badass, dude."
22492,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,I help the weak. It’s yet another way I’m exactly like Batman.
22493,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn’t the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it."
22494,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Anyway, I’m really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school."
22495,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,You’re doing great.
22496,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, I’m sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies."
22497,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,"I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, they’d melt."
22498,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,"Penny, it doesn’t matter what you did in the past. You’re a good person now."
22499,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,That’s easy for you to say. You weren’t just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.
22500,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. Which word’s tripping you up? Assuage or altruism?
22501,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,Both.
22502,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,You’ll feel better by doing something nice for someone.
22503,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,I actually knew that.
22504,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,I never doubted you.
22505,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.
22506,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Ooh, I can’t do that. If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?"
22507,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,"There’s Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor."
22508,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Okay, come on, I don’t even have my own house, I’m going to build one for someone else?"
22509,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,How about donating some of your clothes?
22510,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Oh, my God, that’s perfect. ‘Cause I have so many clothes I don’t wear, and they’re just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that."
22511,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,What about helping people?
22512,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,And helping people.
22513,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,Here’s your cocoa.
22514,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?"
22515,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,Yes.
22516,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,Heated to precisely 183 degrees?
22517,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,Yes.
22518,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?"
22519,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,You got one for good luck.
22520,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,I’ll get it.
22521,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.
22522,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,Hey.
22523,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,What are you doing here?
22524,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"I want to apologize for stapling your balls and throwing you naked in the girls’ locker room, stuffing that parrot down your pants. What’s this word?"
22525,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,Laxative.
22526,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"Oh, right. Junior prom. That was not cool, man. I am so, so sorry."
22527,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,Really?
22528,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,Yeah. I just hope you can forgive me.
22529,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess."
22530,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,You’re a beautiful guy.
22531,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy."
22532,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"Okay, I got to go."
22533,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,Are you okay to drive?
22534,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I drive better drunk. You know, it makes you pay attention."
22535,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"No, no, no, come on in. I’ll make you a cup of coffee."
22536,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,I wouldn’t be imposing?
22537,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,No.
22538,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,Yes.
22539,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Sheldon, we can’t let him drive."
22540,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.
22541,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
22542,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"Not really, no. It’s funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser. And now we’re reversed. You’re the winner."
22543,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,You’d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.
22544,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,You mind if I use your bathroom?
22545,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Yeah, just back there."
22546,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Howard,"How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes."
22547,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.
22548,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,You know what would be nice?
22549,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Raj,What’s that?
22550,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who’ve tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he’s asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn’t say we should do it."
22551,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago."
22552,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.
22553,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn’t down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the… oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away."
22554,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,Donated.
22555,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut."
22556,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,Penny.
22557,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!"
22558,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,"I don’t think Mother Teresa… Oh, that is adorable."
22559,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,Leonard.
22560,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,Yeah.
22561,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition."
22562,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.
22563,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,You’re soft. This world’s going to chew you up and spit you out.
22564,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,When did I have tacos?
22565,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Morning, Jimmy."
22566,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, there it is, tacos."
22567,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"Man, I tied one on."
22568,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology."
22569,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,What apology?
22570,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.
22571,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"Geez, you’re still harping on that? What a puss."
22572,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,That’s my French toast.
22573,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"It’s good. You really know your way around a kitchen, Nancy."
22574,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"I’m not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him."
22575,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,I might kill him right now.
22576,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"The Dark Knight has your back. He’s scared, but he has your back."
22577,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Okay, Jimmy, it’s time for you to go."
22578,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,"Yeah, all right, let me just finish this."
22579,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"No, you’re done. I want you out of my apartment right now."
22580,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"Well said, Boy Wonder."
22581,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Jimmy,Or what?
22582,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,Don’t answer that. It’s a trick question. I speak from experience.
22583,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"I’m not afraid of you any more, Jimmy. Now get out!"
22584,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,Uh-oh.
22585,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully."
22586,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Leonard,"Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?"
22587,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Sheldon,"I don’t need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you."
22588,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,I don’t feel good about this.
22589,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,Then sit in the car and keep it running.
22590,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,"You were right, a whole new load."
22591,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Come on, yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top."
22592,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,"Check it out, Bernadette, suede boots, your size."
22593,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,"God, they’re cute. Oh, why did they have to be cute?"
22594,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"Wait, wait, wait, guys, just hang on."
22595,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,"What is it, the fuzz?"
22596,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,Look at us. What are we doing?
22597,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Amy,"I was gleefully following you to a life of crime, looking forward to the day we might be cell mates. I don’t know about Bernadette."
22598,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Penny,"You know, this is wrong. Let’s put everything back. Here."
22599,5,11,the speckerman recurrence,Bernadette,"It’s okay, I serve soup to poor people!"
22600,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,Completely empty box. If you’d like to examine it?
22601,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.
22602,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Little snarky there, cello lessons. And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If you’d like to examine it?"
22603,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Raj,"Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential."
22604,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret."
22605,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,"Sheldon, he’s just practising for his cousin’s birthday party."
22606,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila."
22607,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Raj,"I’m telling you, dude, there’s a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it."
22608,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,This is how you’re going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?
22609,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,How is this lying?
22610,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You’ve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.
22611,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Raj,"Can’t you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?"
22612,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion."
22613,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,"Sheldon, he’s just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really don’t think they’re gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie."
22614,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,Don’t be so hard on him. It’s natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!
22615,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose."
22616,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,How is that not amusing?
22617,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,It’s still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security.
22618,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da."
22619,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,"Next time, you should open with that."
22620,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"Ooh, look who’s out on a date. Pasadena’s favourite power couple, Shamy."
22621,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?"
22622,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?"
22623,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Amy,"Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night."
22624,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,That is so hot.
22625,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?"
22626,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Amy,How was your day?
22627,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin."
22628,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Amy,Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.
22629,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers."
22630,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Amy,"That’s nice. Anyway, I’ve been dreaming of this day for a long time."
22631,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I’m not gonna lie, feels pretty good."
22632,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Amy,"Sheldon, I’m the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field."
22633,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Air’s getting a bit thin up here."
22634,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"So, are we ready to order?"
22635,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Amy,Give me a minute. I’m gonna go wash up.
22636,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Well, that’s odd. We both washed up when we came in. It’s probably a euphemism for urination."
22637,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"Sheldon, what is wrong with you?"
22638,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don’t know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside."
22639,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal."
22640,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Oh, I see why you’re confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you’re forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That’s all about yucky, squishy things."
22641,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"Honey, she’s upset. You’re her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things she’s excited by."
22642,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,What if they simply don’t excite me?
22643,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"Well, just smile and think about koalas."
22644,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"She’d see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it’s this."
22645,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff."
22646,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.
22647,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,Did it work?
22648,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Ah, let’s just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. Oh, look what my mom made us for the act."
22649,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,Ooh. I like the fabric. Where’d she get it?
22650,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins."
22651,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Mrs Wolowitz,Has she tried on the vest yet?
22652,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,I just gave it to her!
22653,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Mrs Wolowitz,"I hope it fits, she has a tricky figure! She’s short and stacked, like me!"
22654,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"She’s not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!"
22655,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"Listen, Howie, maybe I’m not the best choice to be a magician’s assistant."
22656,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,You’ll do fine. Hand me those rings? See? You nailed it.
22657,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"You know, i-it’s just that I’m not that comfortable with little kids."
22658,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Well, that’s because you haven’t been around them much. This is good practice. I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?"
22659,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"Mmm, yeah, sure."
22660,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Oh-ho-ho! I haven’t seen this trick in years. It’s called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but there’s a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a live… Don’t look in there."
22661,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,"Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?"
22662,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,Yes.
22663,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,How come you’re not doing a mission? You’re just wandering around.
22664,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,Had a rough night. I thought I’d go for a walk and clear my head.
22665,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,Some people go outside and do that.
22666,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"It’s after nine o’clock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats."
22667,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,You want to talk about it?
22668,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,No. I think I’ll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.
22669,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What’s going on?
22670,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Hard as this may be to believe, it’s possible that I’m not boyfriend material."
22671,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?
22672,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. I’m gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?
22673,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,"No, I can’t. I’m playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, I’m no expert in women."
22674,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,I’ll say.
22675,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,That’s not necessary when someone’s trying to help you.
22676,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,I’m sorry. It’s the alcohol talking. Go on.
22677,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.
22678,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,Nuts to that. What else you got?
22679,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,I don’t know what to tell you. Buy her something.
22680,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,How does that work?
22681,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,"Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture."
22682,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it."
22683,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,Glad I could help.
22684,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"It’s appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I’ll be glad to return the favour."
22685,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"And now, all the rings are magically linked together. My fiancee’s wearing a magic ring, too. It made all my money disappear."
22686,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"Oh, ah, right."
22687,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"And now, the great Howdini’s next miraculous illusion."
22688,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Child,When are we gonna have cake?
22689,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,After you’ve been thoroughly amazed.
22690,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Child,But we want cake now.
22691,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"Well, you’re not getting cake right now, capisce?"
22692,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Okay. Okay. Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk."
22693,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Second child,I know how you do that trick.
22694,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,Do you know how to pipe down?
22695,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Okay, we’re going to roll up this newspaper."
22696,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Second child,It’s a fake pitcher.
22697,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,You got wax in your ears? The man said it’s an ordinary pitcher. Howdini.
22698,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Okay, we’re going to stick this in here"
22699,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"and then I’m going to pour in the milk. I hope this works, because I didn’t bring a change of pants."
22700,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Second child,"Look, I Googled it. It’s a fake pitcher."
22701,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,That’s it. No cake for you. Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?
22702,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"She’s just kidding, boys and girls. Everyone gets cake."
22703,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,Not him.
22704,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,Just give me the pitcher. Behold! Wrong pitcher.
22705,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,I told you I’m not good with kids.
22706,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Yes, you did. Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle."
22707,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to take care of my brothers and sisters."
22708,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Yeah, so?"
22709,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I don’t want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isn’t the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Let’s see how you like this waffle!"
22710,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"All right, settle down. Red light. Red light, red light! Okay, we’re fine."
22711,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"I’m sorry. I know it makes me sound like a bad person, but I just don’t like children."
22712,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Yeah, no, we all got that. But don’t you think it’ll be different when the child is ours?"
22713,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"Right, when it’s our kid that’s ruined my body and kept me up all night and I’ve got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that’ll be completely different."
22714,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Well, yeah."
22715,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,I don’t think there’s anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.
22716,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff."
22717,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Ooh, a pocket watch."
22718,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"Okay, I don’t think Amy wants a pocket watch."
22719,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch."
22720,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?"
22721,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Well, she’s very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?"
22722,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Assistant,"Well, how are we doing this afternoon? Are we looking for anything special? Perhaps a ring for the lady?"
22723,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"Trust me, we are not a couple."
22724,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,Excuse me. I don’t see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. You’d be lucky to land a fella like me.
22725,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"Fine, go ahead."
22726,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Trust me, we are not a couple."
22727,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Assistant,My apologies. How can I help you today?
22728,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,He’s in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.
22729,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Assistant,"Great, trouble with girlfriends is what’s putting my daughter through USC."
22730,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"Ooh, are these real diamonds?"
22731,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Assistant,"Yes. Channel set baguettes, 20 points total weight."
22732,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because you’ve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars."
22733,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Assistant,"Actually, that’s only 750. Everything’s on sale."
22734,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.
22735,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,I’m still trying to wrap my mind around it. I always thought I’d be a dad someday.
22736,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Raj,"Oh, me, too. You’re so caring. I’ve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood."
22737,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,"There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj’ll have your babies, problem solved."
22738,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Raj,"Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn’t mean he’s displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didn’t want kids?"
22739,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Yeah, she doesn’t like them. And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual."
22740,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,What are you gonna do?
22741,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"I don’t know. I can’t see a life where I don’t have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers."
22742,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,"You know, there’s no guarantee even if you have kids that you’re going to like them."
22743,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Raj,"Wow, that’s rough. Where’d you get that?"
22744,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,It’s right off the dust jacket of my mom’s last book.
22745,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,Maybe me and Bernadette aren’t right for each other.
22746,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Leonard,"Look, Howard, I’d say there’s a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back."
22747,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"I don’t want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker."
22748,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Raj,What’s your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?
22749,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Huh, it’ll kill her. On the other hand, if I don’t give her grandchildren, that’ll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, I’m golden."
22750,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,What time did you tell Amy to be here?
22751,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,Eight o’clock.
22752,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous."
22753,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?
22754,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?"
22755,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Good, good, if you had said something clever, she might’ve gotten suspicious."
22756,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Amy,Hey.
22757,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,Hi.
22758,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Amy,What’s he doing here?
22759,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"Okay, he wants to talk to you."
22760,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Amy,"Well, I don’t want to talk to him. And I’m pretty disappointed in you, too. Although we both know that won’t last."
22761,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"Sheldon, you’re up."
22762,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"Thank you. Amy, I’d like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And I’m proud of you."
22763,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Amy,We both know that’s your koala face.
22764,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,I told you.
22765,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,"Okay, look, he bought you this."
22766,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Amy,"Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! It’s a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me."
22767,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Penny,You look beautiful.
22768,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Amy,"Of course I do, I’m a princess, and this is my tiara!"
22769,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Sheldon,"You’re right, the tiara was too much."
22770,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Mrs Wolowitz,"Howard! Bernadette’s… Oh, she slipped right by me."
22771,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,Here’s your vest back.
22772,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,You should keep it. You could wear it again sometime.
22773,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,Where?
22774,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"I don’t know, hunting?"
22775,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Mrs Wolowitz,Don’t forget to talk to her about this mishegas where I don’t get grandkids!
22776,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Don’t worry, Ma. I will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!"
22777,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"I guess you talked to your mom, huh?"
22778,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"I was upset. My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesn’t burn your eyes."
22779,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"Look, it’s obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution."
22780,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,Really? That’s great. What?
22781,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway, what if I work and you stay home with the kids?"
22782,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,Me?
22783,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"Yeah. You know, you’ll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and I’ll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life."
22784,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,Yeah.
22785,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"Yay, so we’re good."
22786,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"Yeah, we’re good."
22787,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Bernadette,"You know, I don’t know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?"
22788,5,12,the shiny trinky maneuvre,Howard,"I would love that. But what is that behind your ear? Oh, look, it’s a condom."
22789,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?"
22790,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?
22791,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay, let’s talk about that."
22792,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it’s cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it’s slow outside. I love my mind."
22793,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"We all do. Now, how about dinner?"
22794,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"Oh, I would assume we’d enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other’s tails off and grill them, they’ll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn’t care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded."
22795,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,Excuse me.
22796,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"Permission granted, Commander."
22797,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,"Which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling."
22798,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?"
22799,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Why, you guys going somewhere?"
22800,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"No, I mean just you and me."
22801,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"You mean, like a date?"
22802,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Not like a date, a date."
22803,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,Ooh!
22804,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,Ooh!
22805,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Um, o-okay. Sure."
22806,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,Ooh!
22807,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,Ooh!
22808,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"Oh, no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto."
22809,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,"This is so exciting. If Leonard and Penny get back together, Howard and I can go on double dates with them."
22810,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?
22811,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,"Mm, uh… How’s it going in there, Penny?"
22812,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,Just a sec.
22813,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,Too much?
22814,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,Yes.
22815,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,No.
22816,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Okay, just hang on."
22817,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,"You just can’t handle her raw sexuality, can you?"
22818,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,When did you and Leonard break up?
22819,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Uh, about two years ago."
22820,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,Why do you think he asked you out again?
22821,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,I don’t know.
22822,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,Maybe he’s dying. That would be so romantic.
22823,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,He’s not dying.
22824,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,"Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines."
22825,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,How about this?
22826,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,Maybe.
22827,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,Come on.
22828,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah, okay, no."
22829,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,Do you think you’ll sleep with him tonight?
22830,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Absolutely not. Look, we’re just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes."
22831,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,"If he were dying, would you sleep with him?"
22832,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,What?
22833,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,"Assuming he were dying of something that couldn’t be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head."
22834,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Okay, he is not dying."
22835,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,How do you know? Are you a doctor?
22836,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,"You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and I’m a sexy cardiologist. And the naughty part is I’m not in his HMO network."
22837,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,Screw it. I’m not gonna make a big deal out of this. It’s just dinner.
22838,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,With a dead man.
22839,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Amy, stop it. Oh, God, I’m so nervous."
22840,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,Relax. You know Leonard’s always been crazy about you. It’s gonna be great.
22841,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"I know, but we’ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?"
22842,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,Guess it’ll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.
22843,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,"Sure, we’d love that. Change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this."
22844,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"Mm. I want to build a road, but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood?"
22845,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"I don’t understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?"
22846,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay, how do I look?"
22847,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Howard,"Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?"
22848,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,What are you talking about?
22849,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Raj,Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.
22850,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"I didn’t defile your sister, we had a relationship."
22851,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Raj,"I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, that’s defilement."
22852,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,You want to know my opinion?
22853,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, boy, do I?"
22854,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
22855,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Howard,No.
22856,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"All right, then. The reason you’re fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she’s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother."
22857,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,Where on earth did you get that from?
22858,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"It’s in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby."
22859,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,That doesn’t make it true.
22860,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"It’s called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard."
22861,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,See you later.
22862,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Raj,"If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard’s mother? Sandra Bullock."
22863,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Howard,Why?
22864,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Raj,Because she’s great in everything.
22865,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?"
22866,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?"
22867,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Oh, that’s a good question. How about awkward?"
22868,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, that sounds right."
22869,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,Yeah?
22870,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Hey, how about if we pretend we’re actually on a first date? See how that goes."
22871,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,Okay.
22872,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"So, Polly, tell me about yourself."
22873,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,It’s Penny.
22874,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward."
22875,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Okay, uh, let’s see. I’m from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I’ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn."
22876,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Uh, let’s see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I’ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles."
22877,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,Wow. Can they?
22878,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, God, no. The money’s pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal."
22879,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?"
22880,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds."
22881,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,What does that mean?
22882,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don’t help them set up their printer."
22883,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,You are so funny.
22884,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.
22885,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Leonard, this is nice. I’m so glad we did this."
22886,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?"
22887,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,Whoa. Not so fast.
22888,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"I’m sorry, what did I say?"
22889,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you."
22890,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, God."
22891,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,What?
22892,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,You said always. You’ll always have feelings for me.
22893,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,So?
22894,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"So, that sounds more like something you’d say if you didn’t want a relationship with someone. This isn’t working out, but I’ll always have feelings for you. I’m sorry I slept with your best friend, but I’ll always have feelings for you. Here’s the thing, Lisa, I’m into dudes now, but I’ll always have feelings for you."
22895,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,How would you say it?
22896,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,I have feelings for you.
22897,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,It’s the same thing.
22898,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"No, it’s not. Always made it worse."
22899,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,You’re overthinking this.
22900,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"No, I’m not."
22901,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Yes, you are. You always overthink things."
22902,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.
22903,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk."
22904,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Well, I don’t know how you have a relationship without talking."
22905,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don’t even know what TJ stands for."
22906,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Wait, if you guys didn’t talk, what did you… never mind, stupid question."
22907,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"And now that I have some wood, I’m going to begin the erection of my settlement."
22908,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Raj,He’s got to be doing this on purpose.
22909,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Howard,"Ooh, eight thirty. You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?"
22910,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,You’re thirty years old and you live with your mother.
22911,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Raj,I guess it didn’t go well.
22912,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,We don’t know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home.
22913,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Howard,How about now?
22914,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he’s being murdered. Now, back to our game."
22915,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Raj,You were in the middle of an erection.
22916,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"Oh, of course. It’s right here in my hand."
22917,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,What does she want from me now?
22918,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,What’s up?
22919,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,Do not overthink this.
22920,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,I don’t understand.
22921,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.
22922,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay, but earlier it seemed like…"
22923,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,No talking.
22924,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,Even during? ‘Cause sometimes I have questions.
22925,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Well, that was fun."
22926,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp."
22927,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"You hung in there, though."
22928,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Well, there was a lot at stake."
22929,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,So what do you want to do now?
22930,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?"
22931,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"I don’t know, it’s complicated."
22932,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Well, I’m a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go."
22933,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Okay, it’s just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked."
22934,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,Why? What are you afraid of?
22935,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?"
22936,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,What if I dump you?
22937,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Come on, be serious."
22938,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Well, how about if we don’t think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it’s solid, then we’ll roll it out to the public."
22939,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,So we don’t tell people we’re back together?
22940,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.
22941,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Well, we don’t really have to pretend."
22942,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything’s cool.
22943,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers."
22944,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,I can’t believe you kept this.
22945,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn’t."
22946,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I’m gonna show you how much this means to me.
22947,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,Leonard?
22948,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, hi, hi. How’s it going?"
22949,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"Uh, can’t complain. Thanks for asking. Well, what were you doing out at three o’clock in the morning?"
22950,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?"
22951,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,I was using the bathroom.
22952,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, well, so was I."
22953,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,Really? I didn’t see you in there.
22954,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one."
22955,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,Where?
22956,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"The, the gas station across the street."
22957,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,In your pyjamas?
22958,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,Yes.
22959,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,Without shoes?
22960,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,Yes.
22961,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,On a cold winter’s night?
22962,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,Yes.
22963,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?
22964,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did."
22965,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"Well, then, I guess it’s plausible. Hang on a second, mister."
22966,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,What?
22967,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?"
22968,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,What?
22969,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"It’s customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. Did you?"
22970,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,No.
22971,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,Here’s two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.
22972,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,I don’t want beef jerky.
22973,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,It’s not about you. It’s about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.
22974,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,Fine.
22975,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed."
22976,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,Leonard will be here in a moment. He’s looking for a different parking space.
22977,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Howard,Why?
22978,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, I’d be obligated to do so."
22979,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,I’m so disappointed it didn’t work with him and Penny.
22980,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,"Me, too. Out of deference to them, let’s not flaunt our happy relationship."
22981,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler."
22982,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.
22983,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"Well, I doubt they’d want to talk about that, so we’re fine."
22984,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Howard,I’m surprised to see you here after it went so badly with Penny.
22985,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Well, hey, we’re grown-ups. We can still be friends."
22986,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,"Boy, I don’t know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up."
22987,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Howard,Why not?
22988,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,I’m a very vengeful person.
22989,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Howard,Really?
22990,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,With access to weaponised smallpox.
22991,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?"
22992,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Howard,"Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he’s not gonna get it from you."
22993,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,Howard.
22994,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"No, that’s okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don’t work out."
22995,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s all good. We-We’ll always have feelings for each other."
22996,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,"Oh, that’s nice."
22997,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"See, she knew what always meant."
22998,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Wow, you’re like a dog with a bone, aren’t you?"
22999,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,I’m just making a point.
23000,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,Is the point that you don’t know when to let something go?
23001,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, I’d like to place my order."
23002,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we can’t be together? Because you always have to be right."
23003,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, that is not true."
23004,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,I’ve got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.
23005,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,You know what? I just realized I’m on a break. I’ll get someone else.
23006,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,Well…
23007,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry."
23008,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,Unbelievable.
23009,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?
23010,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Well, I was trying to act like we weren’t seeing each other. That was the plan, right?"
23011,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"No, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. That’s a little hard to do when you’re always being such a tool bag."
23012,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,You know what? I don’t have to stand here and take this crap.
23013,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,The hell do you think you’re going?
23014,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,Isn’t sex after fighting kind of what we do now?
23015,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Yeah, kind of, yeah."
23016,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,What are we doing?
23017,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,What do you mean?
23018,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.
23019,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,That’s because you overthink everything.
23020,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon’s voice,"Leonard, are you listening to me?"
23021,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,What? Yeah.
23022,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,This is a disaster. I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee. Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?
23023,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"I don’t know, he was pretty badass on Heroes."
23024,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"You’re right, I’ll give him a shot."
23025,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?"
23026,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Why, you guys going somewhere?"
23027,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"No, I mean just you and me."
23028,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,Ooh!
23029,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,Ooh!
23030,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Uh, have you thought this through?"
23031,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Leonard,"Yes, and I think we should go anyway."
23032,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Sheldon,"No, can’t do it. Sorry, Quinto, you’re going back."
23033,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,"If you and Leonard get back together, Sheldon and I will finally have someone to go on double dates with."
23034,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,What about me and Howard?
23035,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,"Fine, we can double with you, too. So insecure."
23036,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Bernadette,Where are you guys going to eat?
23037,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,Penny?
23038,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Minister,"Do you, Penny, take Leonard to be your lawful wedded husband?"
23039,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Amy,Penny?
23040,5,13,the recombination hypothesis,Penny,"Sorry, just remembered I’ve got to stop by the drugstore."
23041,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,"Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology."
23042,5,14,the beta test initiation,Amy,"Hang on, Dr. C. What’s vexillology?"
23043,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,Vexillology is the study of flags.
23044,5,14,the beta test initiation,Amy,Cool. I think I just learned something.
23045,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,Did you have fun doing it?
23046,5,14,the beta test initiation,Amy,I’ll say.
23047,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,"Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, Oregon. Oh, look. Hello, Mr. Beaver. In future episodes, we’ll answer some burning questions. What’s the only non-rectangular flag? What animal appears most often on flags? What animal appears second most often on flags? And more."
23048,5,14,the beta test initiation,Amy,Sweet!
23049,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,Why are you waving a white flag?
23050,5,14,the beta test initiation,Amy,I’m surrendering to fun.
23051,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,"Now, today’s episode of Fun with Flags is not fun, but it is important. Flags  you gotta know how to hold ’em, you gotta know how to fold ’em. Let’s start by identifying the parts of our flag. This edge is the hoist, and it’s used to…"
23052,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"Excuse me, sorry, excuse me."
23053,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?
23054,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,Sorry. I’m having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.
23055,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!
23056,5,14,the beta test initiation,Amy,You okay?
23057,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,"No, I’m a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I’m still here. And, take two. Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology."
23058,5,14,the beta test initiation,Amy,"Hang on, Dr. Cooper. What’s vexillology?"
23059,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,Vexillology is… why is there a face on that flag?
23060,5,14,the beta test initiation,Amy,It’s Ferdinand T. Flag. I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.
23061,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,"Confound it! You’re right, it’s brilliant. Let’s take it from the top."
23062,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,That was a really nice dinner. I’m glad you asked me out again.
23063,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"Me, too, I missed you."
23064,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,You see me all the time. You sure you just don’t miss the sex?
23065,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?"
23066,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"I have. You are not wrong. I just think if we’re gonna try dating again, we should take things slow."
23067,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn’t know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off."
23068,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"Okay, well, maybe not that slow."
23069,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"How about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?"
23070,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"You know, just for fun, let’s say I’m not."
23071,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed."
23072,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,You mean like a beta test?
23073,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren’t involved in the development of the appli…"
23074,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?"
23075,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"No, you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That’s our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good."
23076,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,All right. Let’s give it a shot.
23077,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"Great. You keep a list, I’ll keep a list. At some point, we’ll exchange."
23078,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"Okay. Good night, Leonard."
23079,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I’m back."
23080,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,Cut! Take 47.
23081,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,Here’s an interesting fact about flags.
23082,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,I will take that action.
23083,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,"The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasn’t discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics. And thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism."
23084,5,14,the beta test initiation,Howard,Let’s see the new phone.
23085,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,"I stopped on the way to work. Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?"
23086,5,14,the beta test initiation,Howard,"Really? Me? That’s, like, the best part."
23087,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,"Grab a corner. Whoa, what’s your hurry, cowboy? Savour the moment."
23088,5,14,the beta test initiation,Howard,"Oh, yeah."
23089,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,"Speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh, the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself."
23090,5,14,the beta test initiation,Howard,"Oh, let me try the voice recognition."
23091,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,"Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don’t get greedy."
23092,5,14,the beta test initiation,Phone,Hello.
23093,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,What’s your name?
23094,5,14,the beta test initiation,Phone,My name is Siri.
23095,5,14,the beta test initiation,Howard,Look at that. There’s finally a woman in your life you can talk to.
23096,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,Are you single?
23097,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,"I don’t have a marital status, if that’s what you’re asking."
23098,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,"Yeah, you’re right, that’s too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?"
23099,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,I’ve found six coffee shops. Three of them are fairly close to you.
23100,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,I will see you gentlemen later.
23101,5,14,the beta test initiation,Howard,She is gonna break his heart.
23102,5,14,the beta test initiation,Amy,"For someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London."
23103,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,"Careful, it’s that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year’s Who Con."
23104,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"Uh, we’re not counting this as a date, are we?"
23105,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"Um, I’m not sure, but I think the right answer here is no."
23106,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,Bug report
23107,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,Even Doctor Who?
23108,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,Even Doctor Who.
23109,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,"All right, that’s it. Who Con, you’re out."
23110,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening’s activity."
23111,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"Well, thank you. I’ll see you tomorrow."
23112,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here."
23113,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,What’s this?
23114,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,My bug report to you.
23115,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"Well, that’s quite a list you got there."
23116,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,It’s colour coded.
23117,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,Oh.
23118,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There’s a key down here at the bottom. It’s neat, huh?"
23119,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,Yep.
23120,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"So, have a good night."
23121,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,Yep.
23122,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard."
23123,5,14,the beta test initiation,Amy,What’s baffling me is what you could’ve possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?
23124,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,How about constantly talks with food in her mouth?
23125,5,14,the beta test initiation,Amy,"Her heart’s full of love, no one cares what’s in her mouth."
23126,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,"So, Siri, what’s happening? How are you?"
23127,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,I am well.
23128,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,What are you doing right now?
23129,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,What am I doing? I’m talking with you.
23130,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,You have a beautiful voice.
23131,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,"Thank you, it’s nice to be appreciated."
23132,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,I bet it is. Why don’t women like me?
23133,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,Let me check on that. How about a Web search for why don’t women like me?”
23134,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,"No need. I’ve already done that. Siri, do you have a last name?"
23135,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,My name is Siri.
23136,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,"Ah, one name. Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj."
23137,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,Would you like me to call you Raj?
23138,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,I’d like you to call me sexy.
23139,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,"From now on, I’ll call you sexy. Okay?"
23140,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,Okay.
23141,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,"Siri, I’m in the mood for gelato."
23142,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,(chimes) I found ten restaurants whose reviews mention gelato. Seven of them are fairly close to you.
23143,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,"Thank you, darling."
23144,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,"You are most certainly welcome, sexy."
23145,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,"Well done, Dr. Koothrappali."
23146,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,I’m sorry?
23147,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,You’ve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos.
23148,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,I haven’t bonded with it.
23149,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,"Oh, no, of course. I understand. You’re afraid the world isn’t ready for your taboo love. Your secret’s safe with me."
23150,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,It’s just a phone.
23151,5,14,the beta test initiation,Barry,Cooper.
23152,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,Kripke.
23153,5,14,the beta test initiation,Barry,"Heads up. Pwofessor Wothman urinated in the particle physics wab again, so we’re going to move up his wetirement party. Fwiday, five o’cwock, pot wuck."
23154,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,"Thanks, Barry. Siri, remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers."
23155,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,"All right, I’ll remind you."
23156,5,14,the beta test initiation,Barry,"You got Siwi, huh? Voice wecognition on that thing is tewible. Wook. Siwi, can you wecommend a westauwant?"
23157,5,14,the beta test initiation,Barry’s Siri,"I’m sorry, Bawwy. I don’t understand wecommend a westauwant."
23158,5,14,the beta test initiation,Barry,"Wisten to me. Not westauwant, westauwant."
23159,5,14,the beta test initiation,Barry’s Siri,"I don’t know what you mean by not westauwant, westauwant."
23160,5,14,the beta test initiation,Barry,"See? Total cwap. You suck, Siwi."
23161,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,"Hey, don’t talk to her like that. She’s a lady."
23162,5,14,the beta test initiation,Barry,"Well, that wady took high-wes pictures of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist. Waiter."
23163,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,It’s open.
23164,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,Hey. You ready to go?
23165,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter."
23166,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,Can you finish it later?
23167,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"No, I can’t. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we’d have more fun things to talk about if I read more."
23168,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?
23169,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.
23170,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don’t they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We don’t get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, I’ve addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It’s kind of a surprise."
23171,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren’t so tall. We wouldn’t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy."
23172,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,Thank you.
23173,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"Yeah. Oh. Here’s my list for you, right there."
23174,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it’s coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I’m sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it’s right here."
23175,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,Good timing. Dinner’s almost ready.
23176,5,14,the beta test initiation,Howard,Great.
23177,5,14,the beta test initiation,Bernadette,"Oh, smells amazing in here."
23178,5,14,the beta test initiation,Howard,"Yeah, what are we eating?"
23179,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,"Oh, an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck, and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious."
23180,5,14,the beta test initiation,Bernadette,Who’s Siri? Is he dating somebody new?
23181,5,14,the beta test initiation,Howard,Yes. His phone.
23182,5,14,the beta test initiation,Bernadette,Oh. Is that cute or creepy?
23183,5,14,the beta test initiation,Howard,Uh-huh.
23184,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,"Can I pour you some wine? I think you’ll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc, but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn’t sure, but I didn’t want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe’s. Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase Coco Chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri, play some smooth jazz."
23185,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,Playing smooth jazz.
23186,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,"Oh, my God, Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can’t believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria."
23187,5,14,the beta test initiation,Bernadette,I don’t know if I want to stay.
23188,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?
23189,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.
23190,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"Okay, you’re kind of really great."
23191,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?
23192,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up."
23193,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"Right. Sorry, sorry."
23194,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,And stop apologizing all the time.
23195,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,Right. Sorry.
23196,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"All right, let’s shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?"
23197,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.
23198,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta.
23199,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"So, I’ve got a gunshot wound. That’s pretty badass."
23200,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"No, you’ve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe."
23201,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.
23202,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"Well, thank you for a really cool evening."
23203,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?
23204,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,Things are looking good.
23205,5,14,the beta test initiation,Leonard,"So, are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today, last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We don’t know how much time I have."
23206,5,14,the beta test initiation,Penny,"Good night, you."
23207,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,"Guten Tag, das YouTube. Ich bin ein Bavarian."
23208,5,14,the beta test initiation,Amy,Und ich bin eine pretzel!
23209,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,Und dis is Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun…
23210,5,14,the beta test initiation,Amy,Mit…
23211,5,14,the beta test initiation,Sheldon,Flags.
23212,5,14,the beta test initiation,Receptionist,First door on the left.
23213,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,Thank you.
23214,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,"Dave, I found six vacuum cleaner repair shops in your area. Four are fairly close to you."
23215,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,"Hello, sexy. What can I help you with? If you’d like to make love to me, just tell me."
23216,5,14,the beta test initiation,Siri,I’m sorry. I don’t understand.
23217,5,14,the beta test initiation,Raj,No!
23218,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,Aaargh. What the hell?
23219,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,Emergency preparedness drill.
23220,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"Oh, no, come on!"
23221,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Yeah, you know how it works. Once a quarter, keep our readiness up. Now, rise and shine, sleepy head. Half the town is probably dead."
23222,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,I have to get a lock for my door.
23223,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"I think you’ll like the drill tonight. I’ve tried to make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada. Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe."
23224,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California."
23225,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them?"
23226,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,Fine.
23227,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"All righty! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city in flames. The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. Oh, excellent choice. Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest."
23228,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"Oh, fun. I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People."
23229,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"You make that joke every three months. I still don’t get it. Leonard, wait. What are you doing?"
23230,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"I don’t know, what am I doing?"
23231,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Look around you, there’s hypothetical broken glass everywhere. Really? You’re going to face Armageddon without your orthotics? All right, your choice."
23232,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!"
23233,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,Aah!
23234,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,And that’s why we wear hard hats.
23235,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,"Check it out, press release from NASA."
23236,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,"Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom ‘Tombo’ Johnson, astronaut Mike ‘Supernova’ Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz."
23237,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,This is going right into my synagogue’s newsletter.
23238,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,"Dude, if you’re going to be an astronaut, you need to pick a cool nickname."
23239,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,I don’t get to pick it. The other guys have to give it to me.
23240,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,"Oh. If I had one, it would be Brown Dynamite."
23241,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,Are you not listening to me? The other astronauts have to give you your nickname.
23242,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?
23243,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,Because the cafeteria doesn’t offer little packets of methamphetamine.
23244,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,"Emergency drill night last night, huh?"
23245,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,Uh-huh.
23246,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,How’d you do?
23247,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,I’ll tell you exactly how he did. Readiness
23248,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"You know what, I’m so tired I can’t even think straight. I’m going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?"
23249,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,You can’t go home. You have to take me to the dentist at four o’clock.
23250,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"Oh, can’t you take the bus to the dentist?"
23251,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Of course I can. It’s coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia, that’s the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico."
23252,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,They put you under for a cleaning?
23253,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Yeah, they have to, I’m a biter."
23254,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"Whatever, Sheldon. I’m exhausted. I’m not taking you to the dentist."
23255,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. See? It’s right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.”"
23256,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement. It’s ridiculous. I’m your roommate, not your chauffeur. You know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches."
23257,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Well, it has. Ask anybody."
23258,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,I don’t care. I’m done.
23259,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?
23260,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"I don’t know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes."
23261,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Think carefully here. Clause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall."
23262,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,Where do I sign?
23263,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,Right here. Use your finger.
23264,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,There. Done.
23265,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"All right. That’s it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me."
23266,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,I’m gonna go home and take a nap.
23267,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares."
23268,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,I got pretty exciting NASA news today. Next week I fly to Houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.
23269,5,15,the friendship contraction,Penny,What does that mean?
23270,5,15,the friendship contraction,Bernadette,He’s gonna learn to poop in space.
23271,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,"Open the pod bay doors, HAL."
23272,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite.
23273,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter."
23274,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,‘Sup?
23275,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"‘Sup? My apologies. I would’ve been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it."
23276,5,15,the friendship contraction,Amy,I saved you a dumpling.
23277,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Oh, your concern for me is touching. It will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow."
23278,5,15,the friendship contraction,Amy,"I’m sorry, Sheldon, I’m busy. I’m right in the middle of my addiction study. I’ve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrow’s the day we switch them to O’Doul’s."
23279,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"You’re my girlfriend and you’re not going to cater to my every need? Oh, where’d the magic go?"
23280,5,15,the friendship contraction,Penny,"Sheldon, that’s not what girlfriends are for. Although, you don’t use them for what they’re for, so what do I know?"
23281,5,15,the friendship contraction,Bernadette,"Howard doesn’t make me do his shopping, or take him to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?"
23282,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,"Absolutely. But when Ma’s hips give out, you’re up, kid."
23283,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Well, if Amy’s too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled You’re Welcome, Mankind. All right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. Uh, dentist. Okay, we can circle back to that one. Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had hoot written all over it. Um, all right, uh, dermatologist? Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay, okay, here’s a fun one. Um, I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?"
23284,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,Their meatballs are pretty good.
23285,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,What’s that?
23286,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,"Nothing, nothing."
23287,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Hello, Stuart."
23288,5,15,the friendship contraction,Stuart,"Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I help you find something today?"
23289,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"No, no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person."
23290,5,15,the friendship contraction,Stuart,Ninth?
23291,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?"
23292,5,15,the friendship contraction,Stuart,"Uh, not so good. My shrink just killed himself and blamed me in the note."
23293,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Great. Great. So, what’s new with your family? How’s your mother? Is she alive?"
23294,5,15,the friendship contraction,Stuart,Yeah.
23295,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,And your father? Alive?
23296,5,15,the friendship contraction,Stuart,Yes.
23297,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"How about your grandparents, they alive?"
23298,5,15,the friendship contraction,Stuart,No.
23299,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m so sorry for your loss. On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?"
23300,5,15,the friendship contraction,Stuart,"I’m sorry, you want me to take you to the dentist?"
23301,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Yes. And now, I can’t make any promises, but that’s the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot."
23302,5,15,the friendship contraction,Stuart,"Sheldon, I’m working. I can’t take you to the dentist. Also, and I can’t stress this enough, I don’t want to take you to the dentist."
23303,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Can’t help a friend out in a time of need, huh? I see where your therapist was coming from."
23304,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,"Ooh, ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname Howard “Buzz” Wolowitz?"
23305,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,You can’t do Buzz. Buzz is taken.
23306,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,Buzz Lightyear is not real.
23307,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,"No, that’s not what I’m talking about."
23308,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,"Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?"
23309,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,No.
23310,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,"Okay, um, how about Crash”? Howard “Crash” Wolowitz."
23311,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,"Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named Crash."
23312,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,"All right, um, how about, oh, how about Rocket Man?"
23313,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"That’s not bad, Howard “Rocket Man” Wolowitz."
23314,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,"Yeah, it’s great, but I told you, I don’t get to pick my nickname. It has to come from the other astronauts."
23315,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,Maybe there’s a way to get them to come up with it.
23316,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,Like how?
23317,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan."
23318,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,Did it work?
23319,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth. Because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth."
23320,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,"Okay, uh, what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys, I’ll call you and they’ll hear it. Plant the seed."
23321,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,That’s actually not a terrible plan.
23322,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,They don’t call me Brown Dynamite for nothing.
23323,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,‘Sup?
23324,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,‘Sup?
23325,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?"
23326,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Not necessary. No. I found a service that’ll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind."
23327,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"All right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, I will take you to the dentist."
23328,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,Are you suggesting that you’ve come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?
23329,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,Absolutely. If you admit that you’re a 30-year-old man who’s incapable of functioning on his own.
23330,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,"Ooh, Sock Mouth’s got him on the ropes."
23331,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped."
23332,5,15,the friendship contraction,Penny,"Oh, good, your power’s out, too."
23333,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,Why is that good?
23334,5,15,the friendship contraction,Penny,"Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra."
23335,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,Power failure. Implementing power-failure protocol.
23336,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?
23337,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway, it’s too bad you’re no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light. It’s not for you."
23338,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"It’s just a blackout, I’m sure the power will be back on soon."
23339,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,And I’m sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first.
23340,5,15,the friendship contraction,Penny,"You know, I got some candles in my apartment."
23341,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"But candles? During a blackout? Are you mad? That’s a fire hazard. No, Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far safer glow stick."
23342,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"You call that a glow stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, let’s go."
23343,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Before you go, consider this. Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system, I also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle. All yours if you’re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement."
23344,5,15,the friendship contraction,Penny,I’ve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.
23345,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Oh, he’ll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark, he’s gonna be bored out of his mind."
23346,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,To wine and bubble wrap. And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.
23347,5,15,the friendship contraction,Penny,"You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dinisha said you could do that with panty hose. Boy, was she wrong. Anyway, you want to make out?"
23348,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"I thought because our relationship’s in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow."
23349,5,15,the friendship contraction,Penny,Okay. Do you want to make out slow?
23350,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,I can go so slow it’ll be like there’s a snail in your mouth.
23351,5,15,the friendship contraction,Penny,"Ugh. Well, lucky for you, there’s nothing else to do right now."
23352,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Excuse me, Leonard."
23353,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,Since when don’t you knock? It’s like the only good thing about you.
23354,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. We’re in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day."
23355,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"Fine, what is it?"
23356,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,I’m making s’mores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.
23357,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"S’mores, huh? Good for you."
23358,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement."
23359,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"No, thanks. I’m good."
23360,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a s’more by myself. And then I’m gonna have s’more. By myself."
23361,5,15,the friendship contraction,Penny,Aw.
23362,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"No, don’t aw him. He brought this all on himself."
23363,5,15,the friendship contraction,Penny,But he’s sad.
23364,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"No, he’s crazy. Sometimes crazy looks like sad so it’ll suck you back in."
23365,5,15,the friendship contraction,Penny,I think he misses his little buddy.
23366,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"Fine. But mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over."
23367,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,I thought you said candles were dangerous.
23368,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"This is a Bunsen burner. I’m a scientist, I know what I’m doing. Oh, drat."
23369,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,Aw. It took me a gallon of urine to make that water.
23370,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don’t see why we can’t be friends. And I’m willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don’t want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement."
23371,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,What are you proposing?
23372,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation."
23373,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,And how would I do that?
23374,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,You say thank you.
23375,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,Every time?
23376,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,It’s not crazy.
23377,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of Mother’s Day or Father’s Day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. We could call it Leonard’s Day."
23378,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,I kind of like the sound of that.
23379,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Of course you do. It’s about you, like everything else."
23380,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Oh, thank goodness. I don’t think I had it in me to make another glass of water."
23381,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard’s Day?"
23382,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,No.
23383,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,Can I sit in your spot?
23384,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,No.
23385,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,Can I control the thermostat?
23386,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,No.
23387,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,Do I get a card?
23388,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,Of course you get a card. It’s Leonard’s Day.
23389,5,15,the friendship contraction,Penny,"Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch."
23390,5,15,the friendship contraction,Leonard,"Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?"
23391,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Oh, I don’t know. But whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no Leonard’s Day."
23392,5,15,the friendship contraction,Penny,Leonard’s Day?
23393,5,15,the friendship contraction,Sheldon,"Oh, no pressure. Just get him a crummy card, you’re good."
23394,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,"All right, test my ring tone. That really is a good song."
23395,5,15,the friendship contraction,Raj,"Oh, yeah. There’s a reason he’s Sir Elton John. They don’t make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go."
23396,5,15,the friendship contraction,Mrs Wolowitz,"Howard, are you coming down for breakfast?"
23397,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,"Ma, I told you I have a video conference with NASA. I said don’t bother me!"
23398,5,15,the friendship contraction,Mrs Wolowitz,Oh! Listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut.
23399,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,"Yes, please listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut. Hey, good morning."
23400,5,15,the friendship contraction,NASA Guy,"Hey, Howard, thanks for getting up so early."
23401,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,"No problem, Dr. Massimino."
23402,5,15,the friendship contraction,Dr Massimino,The guys here call me Mass.
23403,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,Mass. That’s a cool nickname. ‘Cause force equals mass times acceleration.
23404,5,15,the friendship contraction,Mass,"Yeah. It’s just short for Massimino. Anyway, the plan for this morning is to go over the…"
23405,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,Sorry. My phone.
23406,5,15,the friendship contraction,Mass,What is that? Is that Rocket Man?
23407,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,"Yeah, my ring tone. Kind of my favourite song, Rocket Man."
23408,5,15,the friendship contraction,Mrs Wolowitz,"Howard, your Fruit Loops are getting soggy!"
23409,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,Not now!
23410,5,15,the friendship contraction,Mass,Who’s that?
23411,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,My mom. Sorry.
23412,5,15,the friendship contraction,Howard,"No problem, Fruit Loops."
23413,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I think I’ve come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. Physics Mad-Libs. Now, give me a number."
23414,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,Five.
23415,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.
23416,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,E.
23417,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,And a funny Greek letter.
23418,5,16,the vacation solution,Raj,Gamma.
23419,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,I said funny.
23420,5,16,the vacation solution,Raj,Upsilon?
23421,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Good one. And an electrical charge.
23422,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,Positive.
23423,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a
23424,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Okay. No, no. I’ll start over. Professor"
23425,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,I haven’t seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.
23426,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn’t."
23427,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,It’s not funny. That mistake got published.
23428,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Stop! I’m going to wet myself!
23429,5,16,the vacation solution,Raj,"Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way."
23430,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,I wonder what he wants.
23431,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,"Doesn’t look happy, so I’m guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon."
23432,5,16,the vacation solution,Seibert,Dr. Cooper?
23433,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,Told ya.
23434,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Oh, President Siebert, I assume you’d like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office."
23435,5,16,the vacation solution,Seibert,"No, and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere."
23436,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"You don’t like written suggestions. You don’t like when I give them to you while we’re urinating in the men’s room. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that you’re one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions."
23437,5,16,the vacation solution,Seibert,"Dr. Cooper, the physics department chair tells me you’re refusing to take your vacation."
23438,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,I don’t need a vacation.
23439,5,16,the vacation solution,Seibert,"You’re obligated to take one. And I’d also like you to know the most-often received suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me is can Dr. Cooper take a vacation? Okay, settled, then. I’ll see you all on Monday, except for you."
23440,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"But if I don’t come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?"
23441,5,16,the vacation solution,Seibert,"Read, rest, travel. I hear Afghanistan is nice this time of year."
23442,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
23443,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,No. You should go.
23444,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,"That tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good night, and tonight’s gonna be a good, good night! Tonight’s the night, uh, uh, let’s live it up, uh, I got my money, let’s spend it up…"
23445,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Good Lord! Would you stop that caterwauling!
23446,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,What the hell are you doing?
23447,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Bleeding from my ears.
23448,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,What are you doing hiding back there?
23449,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"I’m sneaking into work. Now, if the guard at the university asks what’s under the blanket, you tell him it’s some lobster traps."
23450,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,Lobster traps?
23451,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Yes. That’s how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.
23452,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.
23453,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Will they, Leonard?"
23454,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,"Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and I’ll drive you there."
23455,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,And no more singing.
23456,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,Fine.
23457,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.
23458,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,I’m so glad you talked Howard out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon.
23459,5,16,the vacation solution,Bernadette,Turn it over. I’m hoping my relatives think it’s Hebrew.
23460,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"This is really happening. I’m gonna be a maid of honour. I’m gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day."
23461,5,16,the vacation solution,Bernadette,You mean my special day?
23462,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,They’re gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody’s head.
23463,5,16,the vacation solution,Bernadette,If I ever actually ever get married.
23464,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,Why wouldn’t you?
23465,5,16,the vacation solution,Bernadette,"My dad. Because I make a lot more money than Howie, he’s putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup."
23466,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,Ouch.
23467,5,16,the vacation solution,Bernadette,Yeah. Howie’s gonna freak out.
23468,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it."
23469,5,16,the vacation solution,Bernadette,I just don’t know how I’m gonna break it to him.
23470,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,"You know, I’m a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you’re in bed with him. That’s how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That’s how I told his brother the same thing."
23471,5,16,the vacation solution,Bernadette,"I don’t know, I don’t want to manipulate him with sex."
23472,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,"Oh, sweetie, that’s what sex is for."
23473,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride’s father. For example, you’re adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose."
23474,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,You would fetch a unicorn.
23475,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,"Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?"
23476,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii."
23477,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,"How about Florida? They’ve got Cape Canaveral, they’ve got Disney, they’ve got my Aunt Ida and the world’s largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride."
23478,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message.
23479,5,16,the vacation solution,Raj,"You know, if I had a week off, I’d go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor, and you’ll feel like you were born without bones."
23480,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,I don’t think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.
23481,5,16,the vacation solution,Raj,Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?
23482,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"It’s like I’m living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life."
23483,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,I don’t think you have a good handle on dictatorships.
23484,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,"Sheldon, everybody takes vacations."
23485,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friend’s biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist, part of the Manhattan Project."
23486,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.
23487,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Now you do, too. Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amy’s a biologist. I’ll go work in her lab."
23488,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,Isn’t that just Feynman’s idea?
23489,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you’re an expert."
23490,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,Hey.
23491,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,"Hey, you."
23492,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,"Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there."
23493,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,"Yeah, I didn’t have any quarters, so I’ve been sneaking stuff into other people’s loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?"
23494,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,"It doesn’t matter what I say, you’re gonna tell me anyway."
23495,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup.
23496,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,Wow. That’s rough.
23497,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,"So you’re saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn’t sign a pre-nup?"
23498,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,"Absolutely not. If I’m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you’re on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?"
23499,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,"I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn’t leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes."
23500,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,"Joke all you want, but you think about it."
23501,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,"Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations."
23502,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,Good luck catching a man with that attitude.
23503,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Boy, oh, boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away."
23504,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,I’m excited to work with my boyfriend. It’s gonna be romantic.
23505,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Way to kill the mood.
23506,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that’s the love story Disney should tell."
23507,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse’s back? Ha-ha, I’m a freak!"
23508,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"Oh, I’m gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers."
23509,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Wash those bea… Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, I’d better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?"
23510,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"No, I just need those beakers washed. Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny."
23511,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"What? Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab. You’re gonna make him do the dishes? That’s like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar."
23512,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"Sheldon, you’ve never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology."
23513,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And it’s still alive. Let’s do this.
23514,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,Where’s Howard?
23515,5,16,the vacation solution,Raj,"No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to where’s the other white guy?"
23516,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,"I’m sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?"
23517,5,16,the vacation solution,Raj,"Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler."
23518,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.
23519,5,16,the vacation solution,Raj,"Oh, that’s a shame, he’s gonna be devastated."
23520,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?
23521,5,16,the vacation solution,Raj,Hmm. I’m gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor’s handing out roses. Follow your heart.
23522,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,Check it out. Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat. Same price.
23523,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,"Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something."
23524,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,"I know, it’s not on my wedding diet. I don’t care."
23525,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,"Uh, listen, I heard that Bernadette’s thinking about asking you for a pre-nup."
23526,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,A pre-nup? Wow.
23527,5,16,the vacation solution,Leonard,What are you gonna do?
23528,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,I don’t know.
23529,5,16,the vacation solution,Raj,Follow your heart.
23530,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,"You know what, it’s not a big deal. She makes more money than me. She wants to protect her financial interests. It’s completely reasonable. Leonard; Good. That’s a healthy attitude."
23531,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,"Yeah, actually, it’s good for both of us. I have assets to protect, too."
23532,5,16,the vacation solution,Raj,Like what?
23533,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,I’ve got some rare comic books. The Vespa’s almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three’s Company.
23534,5,16,the vacation solution,Raj,Mr. Roper’s dead? You can’t just spring that on a guy.
23535,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Here you go. This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.
23536,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,Soap spots. Wash ’em again.
23537,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Y-you’re being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean.
23538,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it’s, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it."
23539,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Biologists are mean.
23540,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes."
23541,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly.
23542,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,I’m sure it was.
23543,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.
23544,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting."
23545,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.
23546,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,366… 367…
23547,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,How’s it going?
23548,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"How’s counting going? When I was in kindergarten, I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this."
23549,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,Great.
23550,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Aw, nuts! One…"
23551,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"This is preposterous. I think you’re giving me these tasks because you’re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, I’ll show you up."
23552,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,Really? Is that what you think?
23553,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Yes, that’s what I think. And I’m super smart, so it’s probably true."
23554,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"Hey, I’ve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You’ve been here for three hours, and you’ve spent one of them in the bathroom."
23555,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,I’m sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.
23556,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"Sheldon, I’ve given you the simplest things to do, and you haven’t done one of them right."
23557,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Maybe that’s because I’m not being challenged. It’s the same reason Einstein failed math.
23558,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.
23559,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"You think you’re doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they’d offer to toast it for me, too."
23560,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"Okay, smart guy. I’m about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it."
23561,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,All right. I’m no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus.
23562,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"You’re getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It’s the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I’m sure it’s no problem for a genius like you."
23563,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"It’s not. I’ll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house."
23564,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"Oh, are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?"
23565,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?
23566,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,No. But your thumb does.
23567,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Oh, dear."
23568,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"Yeah, you’re a biologist."
23569,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,What are you doing here?
23570,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,I’m on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid.
23571,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,What happened to your thumb?
23572,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them, we’ll be here all day, let’s just move on."
23573,5,16,the vacation solution,Barman,What can I get you?
23574,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Ah, seeing as I’m on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don’t let me have too many of those."
23575,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,"Hey, what are you guys doing here?"
23576,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,"We’re grown men, we drink at bars."
23577,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?
23578,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,"Oh, yeah, sure."
23579,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,You and Amy? Good?
23580,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Oh, better than good."
23581,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.
23582,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,I’m not signing a pre-nup.
23583,5,16,the vacation solution,Penny,"All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood."
23584,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"Excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound."
23585,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Amy? Amy? Amy?
23586,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,What do you want?
23587,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,"I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week."
23588,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?
23589,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.
23590,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,That’s not an apology.
23591,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,That is your opinion.
23592,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,I want a real apology.
23593,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,I’m sorry that you weren’t able to…
23594,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,No.
23595,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,That my genius…
23596,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,No.
23597,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,That the soap was…
23598,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,Sheldon.
23599,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Fine. Sorry.
23600,5,16,the vacation solution,Amy,"You’re forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They’re still dirty from yesterday."
23601,5,16,the vacation solution,Sheldon,Next year I’m going to Epcot.
23602,5,16,the vacation solution,Bernadette,Are you mad at me?
23603,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,"No. I’m not mad at you. I just wish you would have come to me, so I didn’t have to hear it through the nerd-vine."
23604,5,16,the vacation solution,Bernadette,"So, what are we gonna do?"
23605,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,You really want me to sign a pre-nup?
23606,5,16,the vacation solution,Bernadette,"I don’t know. My dad’s pretty insistent on it, though."
23607,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,"Why don’t I talk to your dad, man-to-man?"
23608,5,16,the vacation solution,Bernadette,"Really? Oh, that’d be so great."
23609,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,Done.
23610,5,16,the vacation solution,Bernadette,"I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things. Even though he’s retired from the police force, he still carries his gun. But don’t worry, he won’t shoot it. It’s more of a fashion statement."
23611,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,Okay.
23612,5,16,the vacation solution,Bernadette,"And just to be safe, when you talk to him, don’t bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you’re Jewish."
23613,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,"Got it, got it. Will you e-mail me that list?"
23614,5,16,the vacation solution,Bernadette,"So the thing to watch for, if he’s shouting at you, you’re okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact. Not in a straight line, throw some zigs and zigs in there."
23615,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,"You know, this isn’t that pressing. Why don’t I talk to him about it in May."
23616,5,16,the vacation solution,Bernadette,In May you’re gonna be on the International Space Station.
23617,5,16,the vacation solution,Howard,They’ve got a phone.
23618,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Raj,It was a nice retirement party.
23619,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Howard,"I guess. Still, it’s a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down."
23620,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.
23621,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Howard,I wonder how long Sheldon’s got.
23622,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,These shrimp are all the same size. There’s no the logical order to eat them in.
23623,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,Can’t be very long.
23624,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Raj,"Hey, look, there’s Rothman’s empty office. Sad."
23625,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,Yeah.
23626,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Mm, indeed."
23627,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Howard,So sad.
23628,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,Dibs.
23629,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,"What’s up, fewwas?"
23630,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"What are you doing here, Kripke?"
23631,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,"Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes."
23632,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,This is not your office. It hasn’t been assigned yet.
23633,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,"Well, I called dibs at the Chwistmas party when Pwofessor Wothman twied to have intercourse with the toys for tots cowwection box."
23634,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs."
23635,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,You just called dibs.
23636,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.
23637,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,I awwived at the office first. I’m the pwoverbial earwy bird.
23638,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Rothman,Gentlemen.
23639,5,17,the rothman disintegration,All,Professor Rothman.
23640,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Rothman,Good evening.
23641,5,17,the rothman disintegration,All,Good evening.
23642,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Raj,I’m glad that men are wearing hats again. They’re so distinguished.
23643,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,I got you a little something.
23644,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"A little something? Oh, it… what, this is huge."
23645,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,What’s huge is what you’ve done for me.
23646,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Oh, no, Amy, I haven’t done anything."
23647,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,"No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But look at me now. I’m like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it."
23648,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,Okay.
23649,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,I wanted to get you something you didn’t have.
23650,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,Wow. I-I don’t know what to s… Wow.
23651,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,Do you like it?
23652,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,Do I like it? Wow.
23653,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,"So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?"
23654,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I’d have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and…"
23655,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,No problem.
23656,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow."
23657,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,I found him. He’s in the bathroom. President Siebert?
23658,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Siebert,Can’t this wait?
23659,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,I’m sorry. We just need a word.
23660,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Siebert,"Now? You realize I’m your boss, and I am holding my penis?"
23661,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,"Sheldon, give the man some pwivacy. I’m sowwy. This guy’s got no wespect for boundawies."
23662,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Siebert,What do you want?
23663,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,Will you tell this wunatic that Pwofessor Wothman’s office is wightfully mine?
23664,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Siebert,Can’t you take this up with your department chairman?
23665,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.
23666,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Siebert,"Gentlemen, there’s a task I’m trying to accomplish here, and I’m having trouble doing it."
23667,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Oh, my. President Siebert, I don’t mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you’re interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video that’ll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first."
23668,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,"Ignore him, Pwesident Siebert. I’m sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate."
23669,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Oh, he’s just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam."
23670,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Siebert,"Gentlemen, I’m going to allow the two of you to work this out because A, you’re both brilliant scientists, and B, as far as who gets Rothman’s office, I couldn’t give the furry crack of a rat’s behind."
23671,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,"Well, as wong as we’re here, I might as well take a weak."
23672,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,Kripke?
23673,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,Yes?
23674,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,You’re in my spot.
23675,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Bernadette,That is big.
23676,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,So big.
23677,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Bernadette,And ugly.
23678,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,So ugly. What am I gonna do?
23679,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Bernadette,"I don’t know. You can’t take it down. You’ll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy face."
23680,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,Is there any chance I’ll learn to love it?
23681,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Bernadette,That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?
23682,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"All right, it’s got to go."
23683,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Bernadette,What will you tell Amy?
23684,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you’re not in it?
23685,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Bernadette,Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howard’s mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach. I’ve suffered enough.
23686,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it’s kind of heavy."
23687,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Bernadette,"Mmm, too bad you’re not as strong as the dude in the painting."
23688,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Raj,"Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick."
23689,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Howard,It’s numbered.
23690,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Raj,"Ooh, limited edition. Nice."
23691,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Oh, that’ll be Kripke."
23692,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,What’s he doing here?
23693,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"We’re going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn’t work, I’m going to poison his tea."
23694,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,Cooper.
23695,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,Kripke. Come in. I’m making tea. Would you like a cup?
23696,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,"Am I weawing a summer fwock? No, I don’t want tea. Wet’s get down to bwass tacks."
23697,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship…
23698,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,We’re not fwiends.
23699,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Well, that’s a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman’s office, and you will find a way to be okay with that."
23700,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,"How about I take Wothman’s office, and you go suck a wemon?"
23701,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,You sure I can’t get you that cup of tea?
23702,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Raj,How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
23703,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,What the fwig is that?
23704,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.
23705,5,17,the rothman disintegration,All,Hail.
23706,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,How does it work?
23707,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Oh, it’s very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
23708,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,I’m sowwy. Can you wepeat that?
23709,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
23710,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,Almost got it. One more time.
23711,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock…"
23712,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Howard,"Sheldon, stop. He’s screwing with you."
23713,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. I’d smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things."
23714,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Howard,It’s the 21st century. You can’t have a duel.
23715,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,"H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?"
23716,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Not pistols. Minds. A trivia contest, and you may choose the field of battle. Star Trek trivia, Star Trek"
23717,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,"You have a compwete advantage in twivia. You have an eidetic memowy. Pwus, I haven’t watched Star Twek since I discovered the stwip cwub near my apartment has a fwee buffet."
23718,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,It’s gonna be hard to find something you’re both equally good at.
23719,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Raj,Is there anything you’re both equally bad at?
23720,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Both,Sports.
23721,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,"All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?"
23722,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,Five what?
23723,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,Balls in the basket.
23724,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,Ew!
23725,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,"It’s out, wight?"
23726,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,Time. Wan out of woom.
23727,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?
23728,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Raj,Yeah.
23729,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,I get it.
23730,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Hey! He did that on purpose,"
23731,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,"No, he didn’t. Nothing that’s happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let’s try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office."
23732,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,"Making it too easy there, Hofstadter."
23733,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,"No. No, I’m not."
23734,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force."
23735,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,I’m gonna need more force.
23736,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,"Aw wight, Cooper, pwepare to have your heart bwoken."
23737,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,Do I get points for that?
23738,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,"All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It’s no longer funny. Let’s try something else."
23739,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,What do you propose?
23740,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,"Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office."
23741,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Kripke,"Oh, you are going down, Cooper."
23742,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"I don’t think so, Kripke. I’ve bounced many a rubber ball in my day."
23743,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,"All right, that’s enough trash talk. One, two, three."
23744,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Howard,Sheldon was higher.
23745,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,"Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office."
23746,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,Who’s unsatisfactory in P.E. now?
23747,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,"Oh, what a great movie."
23748,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,I cannot believe you’ve never seen Grease.
23749,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,My mother didn’t allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.
23750,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Bernadette,"I’ve got to go. I’ve got to get up early. My company’s testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn’t shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring."
23751,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,"I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting Penny. Good night, real Penny."
23752,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Good night, real Amy."
23753,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,"You don’t have to say good night to painting Amy, ’cause she’s never leaving."
23754,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Bernadette,"Good night, real Penny."
23755,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,Bye.
23756,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Bernadette,"Good night, transvestite Penny."
23757,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish."
23758,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,"You know, can I borrow that movie? Those singing hooligans really got my motor running."
23759,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. It’s just going to be my gift to you. Bye."
23760,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,Thank you. Wait. Where’d the painting go?
23761,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,It’s right over there.
23762,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,Why?
23763,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,I have no idea. That is weird.
23764,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,You hate it.
23765,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"No. No, no. It’s just, it’s a little big."
23766,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,I feel like an idiot.
23767,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"No, come on, you’re not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up."
23768,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I don’t need your pity.
23769,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Oh, Amy, come on."
23770,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,I’m just glad I didn’t go for the sculpture.
23771,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them."
23772,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Raj,"I’m happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I’m going to miss sharing an office with you."
23773,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time."
23774,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Raj,Thank you.
23775,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,Yeah. Call first.
23776,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Rothman,Oh. Hello.
23777,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,Professor Rothman. This isn’t your office any more. You’re retired.
23778,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Rothman,I think the word you’re looking for is invisible.
23779,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,I came to say I’m sorry.
23780,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,Don’t bother.
23781,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Oh, Amy, please."
23782,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,"I’m so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting."
23783,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,I know.
23784,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,I was a fool from Summer Lovin’ to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.
23785,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.
23786,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,"Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me."
23787,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,I don’t think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.
23788,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,I bought you a painting that’s 12 square feet in area. There’s a number.
23789,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Amy, come on…"
23790,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,"If you don’t like feet, you can try dollars. The painting set me back three grand."
23791,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Three gr… Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and I don’t want to lose you out of my life."
23792,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,"I’m sorry, I’m just having trouble believing you right now."
23793,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,Grab your hammer.
23794,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,No. Damage is done.
23795,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Okay, look, I didn’t want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous."
23796,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,"Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool."
23797,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Yeah, th-th-th-that’s what it is, so…"
23798,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,You have such a good heart.
23799,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Huh, I try."
23800,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,Come on.
23801,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,Well where are we going?
23802,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,We’re going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.
23803,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Well, what about Bernadette?"
23804,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,"Oh, screw her. She’s just lucky we let her hang out with us."
23805,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,What are you doing?
23806,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,I’m trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.
23807,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Howard,Why don’t you just turn up the thermostat?
23808,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn’t in my new office. No. It’s next door, in Professor Davenport’s office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause."
23809,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,Why is there a hole here?
23810,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,Why is there a hole in my new office? I’ve narrowed it down to two possibilities
23811,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Raj,"Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That’s nice."
23812,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,Is it? Listen.
23813,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Raj,"What, you don’t like wind chimes?"
23814,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is."
23815,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Howard,The bird?
23816,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"Yeah, It’s completely out of tune with the wind chimes."
23817,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Raj,So?
23818,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"You don’t get it, do you? That’s a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he’s out of tune on purpose. He’s mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?"
23819,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Howard,The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.
23820,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and they’re running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!"
23821,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,"Sheldon, relax."
23822,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.
23823,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,"If you’re not happy, why don’t you just let Kripke have the office?"
23824,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We’re trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!"
23825,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,"And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!"
23826,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,How’s that?
23827,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,Little higher on the right.
23828,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,Now?
23829,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,Little more. No. That’s got it.
23830,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Yeah, okay. That’s, uh, that’s good."
23831,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,I’ll let you in on a little secret.
23832,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,Mm.
23833,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,"Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, ’cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality."
23834,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"Yeah, good call."
23835,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,"But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges."
23836,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Penny,"You’re talking about the painting, right?"
23837,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Amy,Sure.
23838,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,Help! Somebody help!
23839,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,What happened?
23840,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.
23841,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,Why would you do that?
23842,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Sheldon,It’s called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.
23843,5,17,the rothman disintegration,Leonard,Hang in there. I’ll be right back.
23844,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,I’m just gonna run to the store and get a few things. I’ll pick you up when you’re done.
23845,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Okay. I like it a little better when you stay, but all right."
23846,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Barber,"Hey, Sheldon."
23847,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,Hello. I’m here for my haircut with Mr. D’Onofrio.
23848,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Barber,"I’m sorry, Uncle Tony’s in the hospital. He’s pretty sick."
23849,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Oh, dear, Mr. D’Onofrio’s in the hospital. Why do these things always happen to me?"
23850,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Barber,I can cut it for you.
23851,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,You’re not Mr. D’Onofrio. I get my hair cut by Mr. D’Onofrio. You believe this guy?
23852,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, it’s okay, he can do it. He’s a barber."
23853,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"He’s not a barber, he’s the nephew. He’s an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides, Mr. D’Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas."
23854,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,What are you talking about?
23855,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D’Onofrio."
23856,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,There’s no such thing as haircut records.
23857,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Yes, there are."
23858,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,Have you ever seen them?
23859,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"No, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and I’ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn’t have them. Uh, excuse me. Do you have access to my haircut records?"
23860,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Barber,Your what?
23861,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a nephew."
23862,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re a grown man, he’s a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it."
23863,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork, it’s on you."
23864,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Barber,So my kid said the funniest thing today.
23865,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,Nope.
23866,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"When you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky."
23867,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?
23868,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,Sure. What are you doing?
23869,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,I’m trying to get the hair out of my eyes.
23870,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut."
23871,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,Thank you for captioning my nightmare.
23872,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"Lookie here, I got my travel orders."
23873,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Raj,"Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, for astronaut training Monday eight a.m."
23874,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"Yeah, but it’s from NASA, so it’s oh eight hundred."
23875,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Raj,But it says eight a.m.
23876,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,You read it as oh eight hundred.
23877,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Raj,It doesn’t have an oh in front of it.
23878,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"You know what does have an oh in front of it? Oh, my God, I’m an astronaut, and you’re dying of jealousy."
23879,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"So, what kind of things are they… will you stop that?"
23880,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"I can’t help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob."
23881,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother’s hair. I could do it for you."
23882,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we don’t churn our own butter, we don’t, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin’ don’t get our hair cut by bottle-blonde…"
23883,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"Sheldon, be nice."
23884,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, it’s the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair."
23885,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Raj,"You could go to my guy. He’s at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea, they’ll massage your scalp. It’s about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza."
23886,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"Quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from I’m going to astronaut training to Sheldon can’t get a haircut?"
23887,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Raj,"Now who’s dying of jealousy? Oh, it’s you."
23888,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Amy,"I’m a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I’m wanted… I’m wanted… wanted, dead or alive. Sheldon, you’re ruining girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night."
23889,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"I’m sorry. I’m looking for a barber and I’m running out of time. My hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. I mean, if you’re quiet, you can hear it."
23890,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Amy,What about Supercuts?
23891,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,I tried once. They do men’s and women’s hair in the same room at the same time. It’s like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.
23892,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Amy,"Well, this isn’t a crisis. Why don’t you just let your hair grow out a little?"
23893,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Why don’t I let my hair grow out? Um, why don’t I start wearing Birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?"
23894,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Amy,"Well, I don’t know. I think you might look sexy with long hair. The kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. I’m gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while."
23895,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,Hi.
23896,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,"Hi, sweetie."
23897,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,I miss you.
23898,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,"I miss you, too. So tell me all about your first day."
23899,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"Oh, wow, where do I even start? I got to experience zero gravity."
23900,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,Cool. How do they do that?
23901,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"It’s pretty neat. You get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it’s going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up."
23902,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,You threw up?
23903,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"Yeah, and the craziest part is, because there’s no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you’re screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens."
23904,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,That sounds mean.
23905,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"No. Yeah, I would have laughed, too, but I didn’t want the vomit to come back out. Anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?"
23906,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,"Sure, why?"
23907,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"I got a look at the centrifuge they’re going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light."
23908,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Mr. D’Onofrio? It’s Sheldon. They didn’t have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so I got you this. I don’t know if you can read his little T-shirt. It says, um, get well bear-y soon. Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you’d be laughing. Anyway, there’s new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors."
23909,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Nurse,Can I help you?
23910,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?
23911,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Nurse,"Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills, slip out of the ninth floor, and go on a little adventure?"
23912,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, I’m just here to get my hair cut."
23913,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Nurse,I-I see. J-Jus-Just wait here one moment. Security!
23914,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"I got to run. But not with scissors, that would be unsafe."
23915,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"So, if I move my horsey here, isn’t that checkmate and I win?"
23916,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,Hmm.
23917,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"Well, is it or isn’t it?"
23918,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"You know, I think this is a good stopping point. Uh, it’s your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you."
23919,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"Well, no, I mean, your king is trapped. He can’t go here because of my lighthouse, and he can’t go here because of my pointy-head guy."
23920,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"Like I said, complicated game."
23921,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,So did I win or not?
23922,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that’s, that-that’s what chess is all about."
23923,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,Hello.
23924,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,Hey.
23925,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I’ll move."
23926,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Eh, why? My spot, your spot, what difference does it make?"
23927,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"Okay, what just happened?"
23928,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"I don’t know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot, I’m guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events."
23929,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"Uh, sweetie, are you all right?"
23930,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"No, I’m not all right. It’s been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened."
23931,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"Okay, I’m sorry, I don’t understand."
23932,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Leonard, explain it to her."
23933,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"Oh, uh, he’s crazy."
23934,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"I have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. But all my efforts, our dinner schedule, my pyjama rotation, my bowel movement spreadsheet, it’s clear now, I’ve been wasting my time."
23935,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,Good. I’m taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.
23936,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it’s nice not knowing what’s coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we’re trying again. We don’t know what’s gonna happen."
23937,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Oh, please, everyone knows what’s going to happen. But I see your point."
23938,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,I think this could be good for you. Maybe it’s time for you to shake things up a bit.
23939,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,You’re right. I should embrace the chaos.
23940,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,Great. What are you going to do first?
23941,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,I don’t know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. I got it. I’m going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight.
23942,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"I got to tell you, I’m a little worried about him."
23943,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"If I were you, I’d be worried that a girl who’s never played chess in her life just kicked your ass."
23944,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,Hi.
23945,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,"Howie, what happened to you?"
23946,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"We did overnight survival training in the wilderness. Big fun. Big, big fun. I was gonna freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom."
23947,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,Survival training? Is that like camping?
23948,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"Uh-huh. Except you don’t have food or water, and they don’t have a sunset Sabbath service like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer."
23949,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,Do you sleep in tents?
23950,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"No. I slept in a hole I dug in the ground with my bare hands. And at some point during the night, an armadillo crawled in and spooned me."
23951,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,Poor baby.
23952,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"But I did it. I survived. I wasn’t sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit. I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. But somehow as I sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, I found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost."
23953,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,You’re so brave. I’m proud of you.
23954,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"I ate a butterfly. It was so small and beautiful, but I was so hungry."
23955,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,Are you crying?
23956,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"No, I don’t think it’s possible. I’m severely dehydrated. My pee is like toothpaste."
23957,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,"Howie, if you’re not able to do this, come home. It won’t change how I feel about you."
23958,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"Thanks, honey, but I can’t quit. If I do, I’ll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up."
23959,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,"Well, is there anything I could do to help?"
23960,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,No. Wait. Send more underwear.
23961,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,Don’t let this be Sheldon playing bongos. Please don’t let this be Sheldon playing bongos.
23962,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos? Bet you didn’t know that I had bongos."
23963,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s three o’clock in the morning."
23964,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,Three in the morning is a good time for bongos.
23965,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,I was sleeping.
23966,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.
23967,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"No, he doesn’t."
23968,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo.
23969,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!
23970,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,What the hell?!
23971,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"Oh, hi, Penny, guess what? Sheldon got bongos."
23972,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,Why did you get bongos?
23973,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,Richard Feynman played the bongos. I thought I’d give that a try.
23974,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.
23975,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"Oh, Leonard, it’s three o’clock in the morning. I don’t care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt."
23976,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.
23977,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning."
23978,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world."
23979,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m."
23980,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,Roommate agreement? Are you kidding? We are living in a world of chaos. Roommate agreement.
23981,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,Where are you going?
23982,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Wherever the music takes me, kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs."
23983,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs.
23984,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,Surprise.
23985,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,What are you doing here?
23986,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,"I’m here to help you get through this. You can’t do it on your own, you need someone to take care of you."
23987,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"Oh, I love you so much."
23988,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Bernadette,"Oh, I love you."
23989,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Mrs Wolowitz,"Howard, your bath is getting cold!"
23990,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Howard,"Don’t worry, once she falls asleep, I’ll spoon you like an armadillo."
23991,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Amy,He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos. I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.
23992,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,Poor guy. He must have been exhausted. Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!
23993,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Amy,That was kind of uncalled for.
23994,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"No, it was called for."
23995,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,What’s going on?
23996,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair."
23997,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Penny, you’re not trained. You’re not licensed. Most importantly, you don’t have access to my haircut records."
23998,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"All right, honey, look, we’ve known each other for a long time now, right? I’ve taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when you’re sick, you’ve even saw me naked once."
23999,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,"I’m sorry, duh, what?"
24000,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I’m doing. Please let me cut your hair."
24001,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Amy, what do you think?"
24002,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Amy,There’s not a hair on my body I wouldn’t let this woman trim.
24003,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Fine, let’s go. Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch."
24004,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Amy,There’s only so many times a woman can say how about the bed?
24005,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Leonard,What’s this about Sheldon seeing you naked?
24006,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts."
24007,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,Almost done.
24008,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"At the end of the haircut, Mr. D’Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke."
24009,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"Well, sorry, I don’t know any dirty jokes."
24010,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"That’s okay, I never understood them anyway."
24011,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"Okay, what do you think?"
24012,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Hmm, well, it’s a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done, Penny."
24013,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"Ha, told you. Okay, I’m just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go."
24014,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,"Fun time. Hah. Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me."
24015,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,Okay.
24016,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"Okay, yep, we’re all done now. It’s just, it’s good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay."
24017,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Sheldon,Thank you very much.
24018,5,18,the werewolf transformation,Penny,"You are welcome. Yeah, I’m gonna have to move."
24019,5,19,the weekend vortex,Raj,"Hey, want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?"
24020,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"Oh, I don’t know. I kind of promised myself I’d get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise."
24021,5,19,the weekend vortex,Howard,You’re about to walk up three flights of stairs.
24022,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"Good point, I’m in."
24023,5,19,the weekend vortex,Raj,You know what would be great? Let’s do it like the old days.
24024,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?"
24025,5,19,the weekend vortex,Raj,"Yeah. Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food."
24026,5,19,the weekend vortex,Howard,Turn off our phones so our moms can’t call.
24027,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.
24028,5,19,the weekend vortex,Howard,They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.
24029,5,19,the weekend vortex,Raj,We were badass back in the day.
24030,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"All right, let’s do it."
24031,5,19,the weekend vortex,Howard,48 hours of Star Wars gaming.
24032,5,19,the weekend vortex,Raj,It’s on like Alderaan.
24033,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon"
24034,5,19,the weekend vortex,Raj,Woo-hoo!
24035,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Lego’s? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!
24036,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,We are going to play the online game.
24037,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,The online game? Bully!
24038,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,"Gentlemen, as much as I’m sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Flora’s 93rd birthday party."
24039,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,Just tell her I can’t come.
24040,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,She’ll be disappointed if we don’t show up.
24041,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,She’s 93. She won’t be disappointed for very long.
24042,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,"No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it’s none."
24043,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way."
24044,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,You use it to get your way.
24045,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.
24046,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,You gave me your word. You’re coming with me.
24047,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"We’ll miss you, Sheldon."
24048,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. That’s for babies."
24049,5,19,the weekend vortex,Howard,"Yeah, but it’s got lightsabres."
24050,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Yeah, please, Amy! It’s got lightsabres!"
24051,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,Hello Stuart.
24052,5,19,the weekend vortex,Stuart,Hey Sheldon. Help you with anything?
24053,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Yes. I’m attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?"
24054,5,19,the weekend vortex,Stuart,"Uh, I don’t know. Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur. Make a pretty badass cane."
24055,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,Do you supply the the tennis ball?
24056,5,19,the weekend vortex,Stuart,No.
24057,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,Then no. What else?
24058,5,19,the weekend vortex,Stuart,"Hmm. Oh, have this collectors edition Batman utility belt. Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy."
24059,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Well, she’d just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume."
24060,5,19,the weekend vortex,Stuart,"I’m sorry Sheldon, that’s it. That’s all I got."
24061,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, it’s not your fault. I’ve been to the model train store. I’ve been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for."
24062,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,I’d make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn’t in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.
24063,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women aren’t anything but flippin’ pains in the bottom."
24064,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,That’s what your father used to say?
24065,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist."
24066,5,19,the weekend vortex,Howard,"Look, if you don’t want to go to the party, just don’t go. You’re a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe she’ll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller."
24067,5,19,the weekend vortex,Raj,I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn’t help.
24068,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale."
24069,5,19,the weekend vortex,Howard,"Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation."
24070,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,You’re right. I’m smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.
24071,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because we’re in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, you’d think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed."
24072,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,You don’t have to check with me. Do whatever you want.
24073,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay."
24074,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Really, what were you hoping for?"
24075,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"I don’t know, maybe that you’d be a little upset, and then you’d realize that I’m a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little."
24076,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Okay, I’m an actress. Ask me again."
24077,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?
24078,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Whu… the entire weekend? You mean I wouldn’t see you at all? But I ju… No, no, I knew what I was getting into. You can’t put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, papi."
24079,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,Ay papi? What is that?
24080,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,An acting choice.
24081,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?"
24082,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Choo got a problem with that, papi?"
24083,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,Uh-uh.
24084,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,Penny! Penny! Penny!
24085,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here."
24086,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift."
24087,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,Gummy bears? Thank you.
24088,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Now that you’re in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt’s tedious birthday party."
24089,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,Not a chance.
24090,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes."
24091,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"Keep an eye on those expiration dates, I’ve been burned more than once."
24092,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"All right, sweetie, I’m not going to get involved in your relationship."
24093,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, come on. It’s just a simple favour. Now, when’s the last time I asked you to do something for me?"
24094,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
24095,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasn’t a medical emergency?
24096,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
24097,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B."
24098,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,What’s that?
24099,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,I’m going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.
24100,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,Good morning.
24101,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,Hello.
24102,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,"I think you’re really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt’s nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. It’s like a vacation for your teeth."
24103,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,All right.
24104,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,You sure you’re okay with this?
24105,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it.
24106,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,Thank you. That means a lot to me.
24107,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, don’t thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your aunt’s awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends."
24108,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,"Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you’re going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn’t that a little rude?"
24109,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I won’t hear a word the old geezers are saying."
24110,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,"You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don’t mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I’ve already told everybody I’ll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game."
24111,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Thanks. Ooh, listen, I wouldn’t mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gal’s candle blow is clean and dry."
24112,5,19,the weekend vortex,Raj,"Here you go. I’ve got everything we’ll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs."
24113,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.
24114,5,19,the weekend vortex,Raj,"Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much."
24115,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side."
24116,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"Well, we’re always the good guys. In D&D, we’re lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we’re the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat."
24117,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.
24118,5,19,the weekend vortex,Howard,"Hey, guys, I got a surprise."
24119,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"Uh, if it’s yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it."
24120,5,19,the weekend vortex,Howard,"No. Bernadette’s going to be playing with us. So, that’s pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah."
24121,5,19,the weekend vortex,Raj,"What, you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend."
24122,5,19,the weekend vortex,Howard,"I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don’t we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn’t answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she’s parking the car right now."
24123,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?
24124,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"Uh, it is, but I think you might’ve waited too long for it to be funny."
24125,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"I was wrong, it’s still funny."
24126,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, good. Hah-hah!"
24127,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Amy, what’s wrong?"
24128,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,My boyfriend’s a jerk.
24129,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Well, I know he didn’t cheat on you, so what happened?"
24130,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,"I had to go to my aunt’s party all by myself, and everybody was like, where’s this boyfriend you’re always talking about? Is he real, or did you make him up like Armin the miniature horse breeder?"
24131,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,Who’s Armin the miniature horse breeder?
24132,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unravelled quickly when I couldn’t answer the question how’d you two meet?
24133,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,I would have thought at a miniature horse show.
24134,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,"Oh, that’s good."
24135,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,Mm.
24136,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,I panicked and said Woodstock. I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.
24137,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Sure, I get that. I mean, he’s your first boyfriend and all."
24138,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,"Not just my first boyfriend, he’s the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. I’m dating Sheldon Cooper."
24139,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,Yes. On purpose.
24140,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,"He’s handsome, he’s lanky, he’s brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality."
24141,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Well, sickly is the new sexy."
24142,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,Yeah.
24143,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when you’re in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt."
24144,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?
24145,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,That’s hilarious. No.
24146,5,19,the weekend vortex,Bernadette,Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!
24147,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn’t as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn’t make the land speeder go."
24148,5,19,the weekend vortex,Bernadette,Pew!
24149,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail."
24150,5,19,the weekend vortex,Raj,"Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didn’t know how much fun it was killing stuff."
24151,5,19,the weekend vortex,Leonard,"All right, I think we got them all. Let’s divide up the loot."
24152,5,19,the weekend vortex,Bernadette,"Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then we’ll match."
24153,5,19,the weekend vortex,Howard,But I worked hard to get this armour.
24154,5,19,the weekend vortex,Bernadette,"Sorry, I just thought it’d be nice if people knew we were a couple."
24155,5,19,the weekend vortex,Howard,"Fine, I’ll change."
24156,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,Hah-hah!
24157,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,I don’t think I want to play a game.
24158,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Oh, come on. They’re playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again…"
24159,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,Like that?
24160,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Wow. Yeah, b-beginner’s luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can… uh… all right. So, yeah, okay, now I’m gonna drink this entire cup and then I’m going to drink another one… Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?"
24161,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,"Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting."
24162,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on."
24163,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,That’d be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.
24164,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,Wars.
24165,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,What?
24166,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.
24167,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,What’s the difference?
24168,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,There’s absolutely no difference.
24169,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,How do I get him to treat me better?
24170,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, I’d say give him the silent treatment."
24171,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,"No, he loves that."
24172,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,Hmm.
24173,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. He said it was a magical evening.
24174,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"All right, then we’re gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene."
24175,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,I don’t think I’d be good at that.
24176,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"That’s why you’re lucky to have me. Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants I’m not allowed into. Both Chili’s."
24177,5,19,the weekend vortex,Raj,"Bernadette, remember, your character’s the healer in our group. You’re in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard."
24178,5,19,the weekend vortex,Bernadette,I can’t help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.
24179,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.
24180,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,"Sheldon Cooper, I’ve got a bone to pick with you, and I’m about to do it in front of all your friends."
24181,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!"
24182,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,"I’m gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour."
24183,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Ooh, burn!"
24184,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,"And if you don’t start treating me better, I’m leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin."
24185,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,Armin who?
24186,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,Armin… damn it.
24187,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush."
24188,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,You’re hurting me.
24189,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"No, Sheldon hurt you."
24190,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,Before; now it’s you.
24191,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,Oh.
24192,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"I think I understand. You’re the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can’t lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution."
24193,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"Sheldon, she doesn’t want your stupid…"
24194,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,"Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Let’s go."
24195,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat."
24196,5,19,the weekend vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, grow up, Leonard."
24197,5,19,the weekend vortex,Raj,"But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I’ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!"
24198,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,"And that’s how a girl makes a scene. I’m sorry, sweetie. You’re right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, let’s go."
24199,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,What about the Science Center?
24200,5,19,the weekend vortex,Penny,I’ll let you hold my hair while I throw up.
24201,5,19,the weekend vortex,Amy,Rain check.
24202,5,19,the weekend vortex,Bernadette,"I’m gonna go, too."
24203,5,19,the weekend vortex,Howard,I’ll miss you.
24204,5,19,the weekend vortex,Bernadette,I’ll miss you.
24205,5,19,the weekend vortex,Howard,I’ll miss you more.
24206,5,19,the weekend vortex,Bernadette,"No, I’ll…"
24207,5,19,the weekend vortex,Raj,"Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way it’s supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil."
24208,5,19,the weekend vortex,All,Hear! Hear!
24209,5,19,the weekend vortex,Raj,I can’t believe this is only 64 calories.
24210,5,19,the weekend vortex,Howard,"That’s my ride, got to go."
24211,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"Oh my God, I love this chicken."
24212,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free."
24213,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"Okay, you’re right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want."
24214,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Oh, that’s very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I’ll come a-knocking."
24215,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,"Hey, Raj, you didn’t send your RSVP in. I’m supposed to ask you if you’re bringing someone to the wedding."
24216,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,I’ll let you know.
24217,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,"Well, can you make it soon. There’s a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette’s mom, and the other three, mine."
24218,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home."
24219,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,"Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster’s wedding."
24220,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts."
24221,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,"Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom’s trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck."
24222,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Alright, uh, fine, I’m coming and I’m bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one."
24223,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,Who you bringing?
24224,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,Who are you bringing?
24225,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,He’s bringing me. Who are you bringing?
24226,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O’Donnells."
24227,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,"Come on, who is it?"
24228,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,I’m not telling. I’m from Asia. I’m mysterious. Deal with it.
24229,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?"
24230,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,"No, uh, I don’t think so."
24231,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness."
24232,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Hello Mummy, Daddy, how are you?"
24233,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Mrs Koothrappali,"Pretty good, can’t complain."
24234,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Dr Koothrappali,Oh I’m sure you can. Just give it a minute.
24235,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Listen, uh, there’s something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn’t ready until now, but I think it’s time."
24236,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Dr Koothrappali,"It’s finally happening. You’re coming out of the closet, aren’t you?"
24237,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Mrs Koothrappali,"We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle. Just keep it to yourself."
24238,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"No, I’m not gay. If anything, I’m metrosexual."
24239,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Dr Koothrappali,What’s that?
24240,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,It means I like women as well as their skincare products.
24241,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Dr Koothrappali,"Well, if you’re not coming out, why did you call us during the cricket semi-finals?"
24242,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"‘Cause I, I’m tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I’d like you to help me find uh, a wife."
24243,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Mrs Koothrappali,"And just to clarify, a female wife?"
24244,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,Yes.
24245,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Dr Koothrappali,"Matchmaking, very smart move son. Much better than marrying for love."
24246,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Mrs Koothrappali,We married for love.
24247,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Dr Koothrappali,And it’s been wonderful.
24248,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Quantum physics makes me so happy.
24249,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,"Yeah, I’m glad."
24250,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,It’s like looking at the universe naked.
24251,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"Hi, you guys got a minute?"
24252,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,"Sure, what’s up?"
24253,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"Well, I was thinking about Sheldon’s little joke the other night about me eating all your food."
24254,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group’s resident cut-up."
24255,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,"I’m sorry, you are our resident cut-up?"
24256,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Yes.
24257,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,Prove it.
24258,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Knock, knock."
24259,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,Who’s there?
24260,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Interrupting physicist.
24261,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,Interrupting physi…
24262,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,MUON!
24263,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!"
24264,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!"
24265,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,Where did you get that?
24266,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store."
24267,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,You went to the comic-book store by yourself?
24268,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good."
24269,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.
24270,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?"
24271,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Not this time. Then they wouldn’t be special. Thanks Penny.
24272,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"You’re welcome. Don’t worry, I didn’t forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker."
24273,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,"Wow. No, it’s great. Also, uh, mint in box."
24274,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!"
24275,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,Awesome!
24276,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure."
24277,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"Oh, that’s great. Let’s open it up and put him in there."
24278,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,Ah!
24279,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Oh dear Lord. No!
24280,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"Why, they’re just toys?"
24281,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,They’re mint in box.
24282,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,They’re Collectables.
24283,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,C’mon can’t we just open one up and take a…
24284,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Together,No!
24285,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,Once you open the box it loses its value.
24286,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it."
24287,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Bernadette,Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?
24288,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Oh yes. In my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two."
24289,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Bernadette,The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.
24290,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow.
24291,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Listen, I love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she’s here."
24292,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.
24293,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,It’s different. You’re people don’t worship lox.
24294,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,Well clearly you’ve never been to brunch with my cousins.
24295,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Bernadette,"So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?"
24296,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I’ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth."
24297,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Girl,"Excuse me, are you Rajesh?"
24298,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you."
24299,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Lakshmi,Nice to meet you too.
24300,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette."
24301,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Bernadette,Hello.
24302,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,And this is Howard.
24303,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,Nice to meet you.
24304,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Lakshmi,You too.
24305,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,Please have a seat. I’m thinking double wedding!
24306,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Voice of Spock,Dr Cooper. Dr Cooper?
24307,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Is someone there?
24308,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Spock,"Down here, on your desk."
24309,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Spock?
24310,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Spock,I need to speak with you.
24311,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.
24312,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Spock,"It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut."
24313,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Was I hit on the head by a coconut.
24314,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Spock,"I’m not going to dignify that with a response. Now, to the matter at hand. You need to play with the transporter toy."
24315,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,But it’s mint in box.
24316,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Spock,"Yes, and to open it would destroy it’s value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half."
24317,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Well, I’m not going to dignify that with a response."
24318,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Spock,Consider this. What is the purpose of a toy?
24319,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,To be played with.
24320,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Spock,Therefore? To not play with it would be?
24321,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, you’re right. I’ll do it."
24322,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Spock,"Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first."
24323,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right?"
24324,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Goody, goody, goody. This is wrong. This is wrong. I’m so excited, but this is wrong. I’m gonna do it. I’m doing it. I did it. Oh, that’s what I always thought 1975 smelled like. One to beam down Mr Scott. Aye, aye, Mr Spock. Energise."
24325,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Energise.
24326,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Don’t be broken. Please don’t be broken.
24327,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"What did you make me do? Okay, okay, think."
24328,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,It’s only logical.
24329,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Lakshmi,"My goodness, that was delicious."
24330,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake."
24331,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Lakshmi,Impressive. What goes into making something like that.
24332,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake."
24333,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Lakshmi,I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.
24334,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Well, let’s see. Yup, three missed calls."
24335,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Lakshmi,"Four missed calls, two text messages, and a failed video chat. I win. So, what are we going to tell them."
24336,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,I’d like to tell them things are going well.
24337,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Lakshmi,Me too. But before we get their hopes up we should probably make sure we’re on the same page.
24338,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Okay, what page are you on?"
24339,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Lakshmi,"I’m on the one where I’m on a lot of pressure from my parents to get married and settle down, and have a family, and I’m going to do it so they don’t find out I’m gay."
24340,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,Say again.
24341,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Lakshmi,I’m gay.
24342,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Like, dude on dude, but with women?"
24343,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Lakshmi,"I know a fake marriage isn’t an honest way to live, but you of all people must know how difficult it is to come out in our culture."
24344,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Why me, of all people?"
24345,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Lakshmi,"Well, there is a rumour back in New Delhi that you’re, how shall we say, comfortable in a sari."
24346,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,I’m not gay.
24347,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Lakshmi,"Really? The chocolate lava cake? The little soaps in the bathroom? And I’m sorry, but you’re wearing more perfume than I am."
24348,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"That’s Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, it’s unisex."
24349,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Lakshmi,Fill in the blank. I love the nightlife?
24350,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,I like to boogie.
24351,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Lakshmi,Got you.
24352,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.
24353,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Lakshmi,That’s disappointing. You were exactly the kind of phoney-baloney husband I was looking for.
24354,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don’t want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it."
24355,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.
24356,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Spock,"Hello again, Sheldon."
24357,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"What is it now, tiny Spock?"
24358,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Spock,I am very disappointed in you. You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard’s. You should be ashamed of yourself.
24359,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,You’re the one who told me to play with it.
24360,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Spock,"If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise, would you do it?"
24361,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave."
24362,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Spock,"Trust me, it gets old after a while. You must right your wrong, Sheldon."
24363,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he’s never going to open it, so he won’t know it’s broken. And I have a toy that isn’t broken. Everybody’s happy."
24364,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Spock,Well I am unhappy.
24365,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,I thought where you come from they don’t have emotions.
24366,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Spock,I come from a factory in Taiwan. Now do the right thing.
24367,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"You know what you are? Well, you’re a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it’s time you beam on out of here."
24368,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Spock,"Fine. I will just use the transporter. Oh, right. You broke it."
24369,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise."
24370,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.
24371,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,Ready for lunch?
24372,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,"Yep, one sec."
24373,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,"Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she’d found out I’d broke my retainer."
24374,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Hey, uh, can I run something by you? It’s about Lakshmi."
24375,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,Yeah. Sure. How are things going?
24376,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she’s a lesbian."
24377,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,"What do you mean, she’s a lesbian?"
24378,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they’d blow us off, and then we’d tell each other they were probably gay. It’s like that. Except this time it’s true."
24379,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,Then why did she even go out with you?
24380,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but I’m actually thinking about doing it."
24381,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,"Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is ’cause it’s crazy."
24382,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Look, Howard, you’re in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises."
24383,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,"Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette’s or my mom’s."
24384,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"It’s a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I’m married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go."
24385,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,"Why don’t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn’t slept with more women than you."
24386,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.
24387,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,So you’re seriously thinking about marrying someone you’re never going to have sex with.
24388,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,I can’t believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.
24389,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,"Yes, to other gay people."
24390,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,Do you hear how homophobic you sound?
24391,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Oh, I don’t want a broken toy."
24392,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Nothing!
24393,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,What?
24394,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Nothing. I said nothing.
24395,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,That was weird.
24396,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,Really? I don’t even notice any more.
24397,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,I cannot believe you guys aren’t going to play with these.
24398,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,"Well I told you, you don’t, it’s mint in box."
24399,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,I dunno. I just think it’s a waste.
24400,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,Relax. I’m just looking at the box.
24401,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands."
24402,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,What is your problem?
24403,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"My problem is that I don’t want you to break Leonard’s toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her."
24404,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don’t want it to just sit in this box."
24405,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,"You know, you’re right. I mean, it’s from you, I’m never going to sell it. I’m opening it."
24406,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,Yes.
24407,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Mmmmm!
24408,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,It’s broken.
24409,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,What?
24410,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Oh, nice job, man-hands."
24411,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"I didn’t break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this."
24412,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let’s all be mad at Stuart."
24413,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,"You know, I paid a lot for this. Let’s take it over there and show him."
24414,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,Absolutely.
24415,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn’t tell you."
24416,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,Why would you open mine?
24417,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,I didn’t. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.
24418,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,"Well, you should talk to Stuart."
24419,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,I can’t because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that’s a lie.
24420,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,What is the truth?
24421,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.
24422,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,"Okay, that I believe."
24423,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Penny,Mmm.
24424,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That’s a lie."
24425,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,"So, is that one mine."
24426,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Yes.
24427,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,"Well, hand it over so I can open it."
24428,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,"Okay. Leonard, even though I don’t have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it."
24429,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Leonard,"And that’s a lie, right?"
24430,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Sheldon,Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.
24431,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"This is a treat, what brings you guys by?"
24432,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Bernadette,"Raj, Howie told me what’s going on with you and Lakshmi."
24433,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"What, you told her?"
24434,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,I told everybody.
24435,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Bernadette,We believe there’s someone out there who’ll love you for you.
24436,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,"Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn’t marry this woman."
24437,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"So, while I’m waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, I’m supposed to just be alone."
24438,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Bernadette,Not necessarily. I think we’ve found someone for you to cuddle with.
24439,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,"Oh, my goodness. Aren’t you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?"
24440,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Howard,Her. We thought you two would hit it off.
24441,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Raj,I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let’s see if you fit in my man purse.
24442,5,20,the transporter malfunction,Bernadette,Metrosexual my ass.
24443,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning."
24444,5,21,the howking excitation,Raj,"I don’t mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work."
24445,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking."
24446,5,21,the howking excitation,Leonard,You’re kidding.
24447,5,21,the howking excitation,Raj,Why?
24448,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"He’s coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he’s looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair."
24449,5,21,the howking excitation,Leonard,"That’s amazing. You’ll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him."
24450,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,You’re right. I suppose that could be considered offensive.
24451,5,21,the howking excitation,Raj,"Oh, boy, Sheldon’s going to freak out."
24452,5,21,the howking excitation,Leonard,"Yeah, he worships Hawking."
24453,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.
24454,5,21,the howking excitation,Raj,"That’s really nice of you, Howard."
24455,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Hm, it’s no big deal."
24456,5,21,the howking excitation,Leonard,"Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee."
24457,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity’s understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it’s two a.m., get out of my bedroom?"
24458,5,21,the howking excitation,Leonard,Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?
24459,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Well, I believe I’ve done it. And I’m only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it."
24460,5,21,the howking excitation,Leonard,Really?
24461,5,21,the howking excitation,Raj,"That’s incredible. Oh, here, break out the math."
24462,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking… Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn’t going to make any sense to you."
24463,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics."
24464,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Yeah, good for you, and don’t stop working on it."
24465,5,21,the howking excitation,Raj,Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?
24466,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,Yep.
24467,5,21,the howking excitation,Leonard,Still going to introduce him?
24468,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,Not on your life.
24469,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Please, please, please let me meet Hawking."
24470,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"I told you, no."
24471,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,But I said I’m sorry.
24472,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"No, you said, would it help if I said I’m sorry?"
24473,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?
24474,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Sheldon, you’re a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?"
24475,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Um, to go to Jewish heaven?"
24476,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,Jews don’t have heaven.
24477,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,Then to avoid Jewish hell?
24478,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.
24479,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal."
24480,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Oh, you can’t be serious."
24481,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there’s another human being.
24482,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?
24483,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Yeah, okay, I can see you’re going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you’re the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps."
24484,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,Get out of my lab.
24485,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Oh, now they’re so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?"
24486,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,Get out.
24487,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,How about dolphins?
24488,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,Out!
24489,5,21,the howking excitation,Leonard,"So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?"
24490,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,It was great. We talked about movies.
24491,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,Oh!
24492,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,I showed him some card tricks.
24493,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,Oh!
24494,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.
24495,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,Oh!
24496,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Something got you down there, bunky?"
24497,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Howard, please, I’m begging you."
24498,5,21,the howking excitation,Leonard,"Raj, you’re our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?"
24499,5,21,the howking excitation,Raj,"Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn’t believe in to end his life quickly."
24500,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween."
24501,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,You’re kidding.
24502,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"No, sir, no, I took my dad’s desk chair, attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy."
24503,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"You don’t seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111."
24504,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,It’s actually 01100111.
24505,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,No!
24506,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"I’m not asking for me, I’m asking for Hawking."
24507,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Let me try gansta, hells no."
24508,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I’ve made, he’ll reach out to me."
24509,5,21,the howking excitation,Leonard,What if he doesn’t?
24510,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"He will, he’s really smart."
24511,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,That’s an interesting idea. Why don’t you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?
24512,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,How do I do that?
24513,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,You walk away.
24514,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,Walking away.
24515,5,21,the howking excitation,Leonard,You do realize you own his ass right now.
24516,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,I do.
24517,5,21,the howking excitation,Raj,You can make him do anything you want.
24518,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Yeah, I know, I’m just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him."
24519,5,21,the howking excitation,Raj,"Well, don’t be too mean."
24520,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Hey, fellas, I’m thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some."
24521,5,21,the howking excitation,Raj,I wouldn’t mind a glass.
24522,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,I wasn’t talking to you.
24523,5,21,the howking excitation,Raj,Bring him to his bony knees.
24524,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Sheldon, come on back."
24525,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Yes, yes. What did you decide?"
24526,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,I’ll give your paper to Professor Hawking.
24527,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Great, thank you. Oh, that’s terrific."
24528,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"But in exchange, I’d like you to do a few things for me."
24529,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,What kinds of things?
24530,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?
24531,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,Of course.
24532,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,You should be so lucky.
24533,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,All right. What would you like me to do first?
24534,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Well, I thought I’d start you off by polishing my belt buckles."
24535,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw’s silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat."
24536,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,That’s nice.
24537,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,That’s a lot of belt buckles.
24538,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, I’ll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you’re seeing there is splash back."
24539,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw’s forks never had that.
24540,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room."
24541,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Sheldon, these look great. They’re like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How’d you get them so shiny?"
24542,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off."
24543,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.
24544,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?
24545,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong."
24546,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,And you want me to return it for you?
24547,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"No, no, no, mon petit cherie."
24548,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,What are you all staring at? Didn’t you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?
24549,5,21,the howking excitation,Penny,Hey.
24550,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,Hello.
24551,5,21,the howking excitation,Penny,It’s not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?
24552,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,This is not my laundry.
24553,5,21,the howking excitation,Penny,"Wow, are these Amy’s? Kind of trashy, good for her."
24554,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,Those are Howard’s.
24555,5,21,the howking excitation,Penny,Ugh. Why are you washing Howard’s man panties?
24556,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Because if I don’t, he won’t give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He’s a famous physicist."
24557,5,21,the howking excitation,Penny,"Yeah, yeah, I know, he’s the wheelchair dude who invented time."
24558,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,That’s close enough.
24559,5,21,the howking excitation,Penny,"I don’t understand, why doesn’t Howard just introduce you to the guy?"
24560,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Because he’s punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don’t think I’m condescending, do you?"
24561,5,21,the howking excitation,Penny,Well…
24562,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry, condescending means…"
24563,5,21,the howking excitation,Penny,"I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down."
24564,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone."
24565,5,21,the howking excitation,Penny,"Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet."
24566,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.
24567,5,21,the howking excitation,Penny,"See, there it is, there’s that twinkle."
24568,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Well, I can’t help it. That’s an involuntary twinkle."
24569,5,21,the howking excitation,Penny,"What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?"
24570,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.
24571,5,21,the howking excitation,Penny,"Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason."
24572,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,I knew it.
24573,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,What’s the matter?
24574,5,21,the howking excitation,Bernadette,"Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get ‘im."
24575,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"It’s not her fault. She’s getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid’s costume."
24576,5,21,the howking excitation,Bernadette,"Oh, my God, that’s terrible."
24577,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Hey, I gave you first crack at it."
24578,5,21,the howking excitation,Bernadette,Why are you doing that? You’re being mean to him.
24579,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,He’s mean to me all the time. You’ve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.
24580,5,21,the howking excitation,Bernadette,"If you don’t want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. I have one, they’re great."
24581,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Oh, come on, the man torments me. I’m just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine."
24582,5,21,the howking excitation,Bernadette,It’s not the same thing. Sheldon doesn’t know when he’s being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.
24583,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Fine, I’ll just make him do a couple more things, then I’ll stop."
24584,5,21,the howking excitation,Bernadette,"No, you have to stop now."
24585,5,21,the howking excitation,Mrs Wolowitz,"Bernadette, I want to remind you, you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow!"
24586,5,21,the howking excitation,Bernadette,"Oh, damn. I’m sorry, I can’t make it, but Sheldon’s going to go with you! And that’s the last thing you do to him."
24587,5,21,the howking excitation,Mrs Wolowitz,Sheldon! I need your help!
24588,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?"
24589,5,21,the howking excitation,Mrs Wolowitz,"It’s this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. It’s like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!"
24590,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,What do you want me to do?
24591,5,21,the howking excitation,Mrs Wolowitz,"We’re gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful, and start stuffing."
24592,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,I’m not sure how to do this.
24593,5,21,the howking excitation,Mrs Wolowitz,"It’s easy, just pretend you’re putting away a sleeping bag."
24594,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Sleeping bags don’t usually sweat this much, but okay."
24595,5,21,the howking excitation,Mrs Wolowitz,Now zip me up.
24596,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond."
24597,5,21,the howking excitation,Mrs Wolowitz,"You’re right, who am I kidding? You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon. The fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy. Why did I eat it all? Would you hold me?"
24598,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Oh, no, you know, I’m not really the holding kind of… Oh!"
24599,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs."
24600,5,21,the howking excitation,Leonard,What are these?
24601,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?"
24602,5,21,the howking excitation,Raj,"Wow, that’s amazing."
24603,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went."
24604,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother."
24605,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.
24606,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?
24607,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,I don’t know.
24608,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Oh, for heaven’s sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom."
24609,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"All right, Sheldon, there’s only one thing left I want you to do. Don’t worry, it’s an easy one."
24610,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,Okay.
24611,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,Give me a compliment.
24612,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,Fine. You have very tiny hands.
24613,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"No, about my job. I want you to tell me I’m good at what I do."
24614,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,You’re obviously good at what you do.
24615,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Well, then why are you always ripping on me?"
24616,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It’s just that what you do is not worth doing."
24617,5,21,the howking excitation,Leonard,It’s nicer than anything he’s ever said to me. I’d take it and run.
24618,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Thank you, Sheldon."
24619,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,Now will you give my paper to Hawking?
24620,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,"Sorry, I can’t."
24621,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"What, why not?"
24622,5,21,the howking excitation,Howard,I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.
24623,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I’m available at his earliest convenience."
24624,5,21,the howking excitation,Raj,I thought he might be a little more excited.
24625,5,21,the howking excitation,Leonard,Give it a second.
24626,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Professor Hawking, it’s an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir."
24627,5,21,the howking excitation,Hawking,I know.
24628,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,I want to thank you for taking time to see me.
24629,5,21,the howking excitation,Hawking,My pleasure. I enjoyed reading your paper very much. You clearly have a brilliant mind.
24630,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,I know.
24631,5,21,the howking excitation,Hawking,Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.
24632,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower."
24633,5,21,the howking excitation,Hawking,That’s nice. Too bad it’s wrong.
24634,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,What do you mean wrong?
24635,5,21,the howking excitation,Hawking,You made an arithmetic mistake on page two. It was quite the boner.
24636,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"No, no, th-th-th-that can’t be right. I-I don’t make arithmetic mistakes."
24637,5,21,the howking excitation,Hawking,Are you saying I do?
24638,5,21,the howking excitation,Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It’s just, I was thinking… Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking."
24639,5,21,the howking excitation,Hawking,"Great, another fainter."
24640,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling.
24641,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,"Fine, I’ll tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it."
24642,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"Okay, uh, I’d pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I’ve always dreamed of having."
24643,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,Wrong. Leonard?
24644,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth."
24645,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,"Wrong, and let’s keep it clean, shall we?"
24646,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"Kangaroo, uh, I’d be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball."
24647,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Also instead of just living in your mother’s house, you could actually live inside her body."
24648,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,"Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you’d be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad."
24649,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.
24650,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,"All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, I’ll just snack on this sunlight."
24651,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,He got us again.
24652,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"No, he didn’t."
24653,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"Anyway, if it’s okay with you, we should talk about Howard’s bachelor party."
24654,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,"Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you’re half swan."
24655,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"I’ve been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price if we’re flexible on age range and number of limbs."
24656,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no strippers."
24657,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,You don’t want strippers? You’re the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.
24658,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"What can I tell ya, I’m not into that stuff any more."
24659,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Good for you, Howard. I’m proud of you. And still, you’re the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special."
24660,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.
24661,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"Well, it’s probably not for me."
24662,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They’ve got that wine train.
24663,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,"Boo, wine! But yay, trains. I’m in."
24664,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"Anyway, it’s a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel through the vineyards. There’s a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It’s magic."
24665,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them."
24666,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"So, I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight."
24667,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about."
24668,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,Why should I worry?
24669,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Well, I don’t know. It’s a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn’t that make you a little jealous?"
24670,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Oh, come on Leonard, it’s you. What’s going to happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you’d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework."
24671,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff."
24672,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,Really? What is the craziest thing you’ve ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.
24673,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Oh, come on, that’s got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died."
24674,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Well, have fun tonight."
24675,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen."
24676,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Yeah, there is."
24677,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"You know, there’s nothing wrong helping some woman’s kid get through their S.A.T.’s."
24678,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party."
24679,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,It’s not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.
24680,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,Are you drinking whisky?
24681,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,"Indeed. If I’m to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers! That’s yucky."
24682,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Whoa, it’s a little early to start dropping J-bombs, don’t you think?"
24683,5,22,the stag convergence,Wil Wheaton,"Hey, you guys."
24684,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard."
24685,5,22,the stag convergence,Wil,"Well, it was either this or another hot tub party at George Takei’s house."
24686,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,"I’m confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group."
24687,5,22,the stag convergence,Wil,"Oh, I’m friends with Howard too."
24688,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,Oh. I guess you’re just friends with anybody.
24689,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,Aagh!
24690,5,22,the stag convergence,Stuart,"Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little tight at the comic book store. I might need some help covering my share of the check."
24691,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Oh, yeah, no worries."
24692,5,22,the stag convergence,Stuart,And maybe a few bucks for the valet.
24693,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Oh, all right."
24694,5,22,the stag convergence,Stuart,And gas money to get home.
24695,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
24696,5,22,the stag convergence,Stuart,Great. You know what? This is my grandfather’s watch.
24697,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,Oh.
24698,5,22,the stag convergence,Stuart,"18-carat gold, got it in Europe during the war."
24699,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Wow, that’s very nice."
24700,5,22,the stag convergence,Stuart,Mm-hmm. A hundred bucks and it’s yours.
24701,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"Hey, everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he’s a jolly good fellow…"
24702,5,22,the stag convergence,All,"For he’s a jolly good fellow, for he’s a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny."
24703,5,22,the stag convergence,Kripke,"Yes, yes, yes. He’s a jowwy good fewwow. What time do the stwippers awwive?"
24704,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"Actually, Barry, we’re not going to have strippers tonight."
24705,5,22,the stag convergence,Kripke,"Ah, then what the fwig did I get two hundwed dowwaws in singles out for?"
24706,5,22,the stag convergence,Stuart,You want to buy a watch?
24707,5,22,the stag convergence,Amy,"This is Maid of Honour Amy Farrah Fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day. Let’s check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman, and her friend who’s about to get married. Ladies, can you tell us what you’re doing?"
24708,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,"Um, these are gift bags we’re going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a map of Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants. And then, for Howie’s relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and medicine for diarrhoea and constipation."
24709,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Yeah, we labeled them stop and go."
24710,5,22,the stag convergence,Amy,"All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night you’ll be consummating your marriage. What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?"
24711,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,"Amy, please."
24712,5,22,the stag convergence,Amy,Keeping in mind that whoever’s on top may set the tone for the marriage.
24713,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Okay, show’s over."
24714,5,22,the stag convergence,Amy,"Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. Don’t you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?"
24715,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,I don’t care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howard’s name? Not who’s going to sit on who?
24716,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,I’ve actually been thinking I’m going to hyphenate
24717,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps it up."
24718,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,"Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family and his family were neighbours."
24719,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Oh, that’s cool."
24720,5,22,the stag convergence,Amy,"No, it’s not. I’ll explain it to you later."
24721,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"May I have your attention, please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz."
24722,5,22,the stag convergence,All,Hear! Hear!
24723,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,"And, apparently, Wil Wheaton’s best friend."
24724,5,22,the stag convergence,Wil,Sheldon…
24725,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,Talk to the hand.
24726,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,Does anyone have any words they’d like to say about our man of the evening?
24727,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,"Yeah, I do."
24728,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,"As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howard’s expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought you’d be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let’s see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you’re actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that’s a zinger, because you’re not. I’ve always thought that you’d make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you’d be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don’t see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don’t!"
24729,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,Sheldon…
24730,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that.
24731,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn’t even wearing my Aquasocks. Then…"
24732,5,22,the stag convergence,Kripke,"Nobody cares, Hofstadter. Wwap it up."
24733,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,Right. To Howard.
24734,5,22,the stag convergence,All,To Howard.
24735,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,I totally had sex in the ocean.
24736,5,22,the stag convergence,Stuart,"Okay, I’ll go. Howard, when I think about you and Bernadette starting this wonderful life together, I can’t help but get a little choked up. I mean, look at you. You have everything. Look at me. I’m 37. I sleep in the back of a comic book store, and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man. To Howard."
24737,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"Yeah, to Howard. Um, uh, who’s next?"
24738,5,22,the stag convergence,Kripke,"I’ll go. Howard, I’m gonna say something to you that evewybody’s thinking but no one has the couwage to say out woud. When you invite a man to a bachewor pawty, the impwication is, there will be stwippews. Maybe not compwetewy nude, but at weast pasties and G-stwings. That’s not unweasonable."
24739,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"Hear, hear."
24740,5,22,the stag convergence,All,"Hear, hear."
24741,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh? No? Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay, when I first came to this country, I-I didn’t know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world."
24742,5,22,the stag convergence,Kripke,"Yeah, nice speech, Fwancine."
24743,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"I’m not done, but thank you."
24744,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"I think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I’m addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin."
24745,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,She was my second cousin.
24746,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!
24747,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite!"
24748,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"Okay, buddy, that’s it. Sit down."
24749,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?"
24750,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,Don’t remember. Please sit down.
24751,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"The only threesome I’ve ever had in my life, and I’m proud to say it was with this man right here."
24752,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"Oh, please shut up."
24753,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"Oh, oh, don’t get me wrong, nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us."
24754,5,22,the stag convergence,Wil,"Oh, Internet, this is so going all over you."
24755,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,"Jeepers, I’m drunk."
24756,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"Thank you for picking us up. There’s a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle. You cannot be operatin’ heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!"
24757,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,Funny. You boys have a nice time?
24758,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"Yeah, it was great. And low-key, like I promised. No hanky-panky, no strippers. Just the guys telling jokes."
24759,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,That’s nice.
24760,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this."
24761,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite."
24762,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"You know, we’re not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car, I can walk from here."
24763,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,"You ain’t goin’ anywhere, Threeway."
24764,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"Bernadette, listen…"
24765,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,"You lied to me. You said you told me about all the girls you’ve been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!"
24766,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"Seriously, you don’t even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street."
24767,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"Okay, just to set the record straight, I didn’t hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj. That is not how we treat women in this country."
24768,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,Don’t you try and blame this on him.
24769,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"Thank you, Bernadette."
24770,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,"Zip it, pervert!"
24771,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m supposed to marry Howard in a couple of weeks and I’m not sure I even know who the man is any more.
24772,5,22,the stag convergence,Amy,"I’m curious what’s bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children’s cartoon?"
24773,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn’t?"
24774,5,22,the stag convergence,Amy,Right. And that was…
24775,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,Not.
24776,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,"When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother."
24777,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Well, if that’s what you like, I’ll take you to the comic book store, the place is full of ’em."
24778,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,Wait a minute. You set me up with Howard. Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?
24779,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Well, a little. You hear stuff."
24780,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,Why didn’t you tell me
24781,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Well, I was gonna, but I didn’t think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldn’t go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you."
24782,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,My God! I thought you were my friend.
24783,5,22,the stag convergence,Amy,I don’t think that was helpful.
24784,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"Hi, Bernie, it’s me again. Please call me back."
24785,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,"Dude, I am so sorry."
24786,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"It’s not your fault, it’s mine. I did all that stuff, not you."
24787,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Actually, you did do one of them together."
24788,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,Here.
24789,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,What is this?
24790,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,You’re upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.
24791,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"No, but what is it?"
24792,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,"Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it’s been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, two birds."
24793,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,I don’t know what my next move is.
24794,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Well, Howard, I don’t know much about women."
24795,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,Yeah?
24796,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"No, uh, that, that’s it. I don’t know much about women. Raj, you got anything?"
24797,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,I’ve got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.
24798,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,I’m not calling the girl from Comic-con.
24799,5,22,the stag convergence,Raj,All right. More Sailor Moon for me.
24800,5,22,the stag convergence,Sheldon,I just threw up the bachelor party.
24801,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Please come out, Bernadette. Let’s talk through this."
24802,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,"No, leave me alone."
24803,5,22,the stag convergence,Amy,Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?
24804,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,Amy.
24805,5,22,the stag convergence,Amy,"Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. I’m just trying to clean up your mess."
24806,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"Oh, hi."
24807,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,Hey.
24808,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,I need to talk to Bernadette.
24809,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Well, I don’t think she wants to talk to anyone right now."
24810,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"All right, well, could you at least give her a message?"
24811,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Yeah, sure, I guess."
24812,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"Tell her I’m really sorry, and if she doesn’t want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she’s disgusted by, is the guy that I’m disgusted by, too. But that guy doesn’t exist any more, he’s gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you."
24813,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Oh, my God, Howard. That’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard. And it came out of you."
24814,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,Howie?
24815,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,Penny has a message for you.
24816,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,"I heard. Your voice, not unlike your mother’s, travels through walls."
24817,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,Do you want me to go?
24818,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,No. Come here. I’m still really mad at you.
24819,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,I get that.
24820,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,Is there anything else about your past I should know?
24821,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. I’ll tell you later."
24822,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,Okay.
24823,5,22,the stag convergence,Howard,"So, is the wedding still on?"
24824,5,22,the stag convergence,Bernadette,"Yeah, the wedding’s still on."
24825,5,22,the stag convergence,Amy,"Oh, thank God. I’m still a maid of honour."
24826,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"Oh, what the hell."
24827,5,22,the stag convergence,Amy,This is kind of hot.
24828,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,Hello.
24829,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,What’s with the robe?
24830,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"I’m gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine."
24831,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"No, you’re not."
24832,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Come on, please."
24833,5,22,the stag convergence,Penny,"If you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet."
24834,5,22,the stag convergence,Leonard,"Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy."
24835,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,Howard Wolowitz.
24836,5,23,the launch acceleration,Voice,"Hey, Howard. Dave Roeger here at NASA. We need to talk about your upcoming mission."
24837,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Yes, yes, I’ve been doing my push-ups. I’m still stuck at nine, but that’s going all the way down with no one holding me."
24838,5,23,the launch acceleration,Roeger,"That’s great, uh, but that’s not why I called. We’ve run into a bit of a snafu. Your Soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test, so bottom line, mission’s been scrubbed."
24839,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"You’re kidding. So what does that mean? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Boy, I got to tell you, I’m really disappointed. This was my dream ever since I was a little kid. Okay, well, uh, thanks for the call. Yep, you, too."
24840,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Yes! Thank you! Oh! Oh! I’m not gonna die in space! I’m gonna die the way God intended, in my late 50s, with a heart full of pastrami."
24841,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,I’m going to need a larger shirt. This one’s a little tight under the arms.
24842,5,23,the launch acceleration,Assistant,Okay.
24843,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,Do you think maybe it’s tight because you’re wearing long underwear?
24844,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"Yes, of course that’s why it’s tight."
24845,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?"
24846,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,You’re kidding. Shouldn’t the question be why aren’t you?
24847,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"No, it should be"
24848,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I don’t like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think I feel about theirs?"
24849,5,23,the launch acceleration,Assistant,Why don’t you slip this on?
24850,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,Said the hangman offering a noose.
24851,5,23,the launch acceleration,Raj,"Well, that wasn’t as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there."
24852,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Well, that’s it. My orders have been rescinded. I am officially no go to space."
24853,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"I’m sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you, I’m a little relieved you’re not going."
24854,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,Why?
24855,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians."
24856,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Yeah, so?"
24857,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this Blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in Russia”?"
24858,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Well, their technology isn’t that bad."
24859,5,23,the launch acceleration,Raj,"When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour, and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle."
24860,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"All right, well, whatever. I wasn’t worried."
24861,5,23,the launch acceleration,Raj,You weren’t?
24862,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,Let me explain the difference between you and me. You watch Star Trek. I live it.
24863,5,23,the launch acceleration,Raj,"Oh, please. I don’t remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store."
24864,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Make all the jokes you want, but there’s only one of us here brave enough to almost do what I almost did."
24865,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"Ah, much better."
24866,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,You must be burning up.
24867,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever’s in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don’t I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!"
24868,5,23,the launch acceleration,Assistant,"Uh, where’s he going?"
24869,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,He keeps emergency Purell in the car.
24870,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,Keys! Keys! Keys!
24871,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"Hey, you."
24872,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"Before I come in, you should know, I have gas."
24873,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"For the record, not your worst opening line."
24874,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,Check it out. It’s the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in.
24875,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"B-Before I do it, if you’re a cop you have tell me, right?"
24876,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,Just try it.
24877,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,Okay.
24878,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"What’s it supposed to… Oh, my God, this is so freaky!"
24879,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,You’re a mean one Mr. Grinch.
24880,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"Okay. Me, me, me. Ready?"
24881,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"Leonard, I am your father."
24882,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.
24883,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"Oh, Mm. Hey, you know how we’ve been taking things slow?"
24884,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,Mm-hmm.
24885,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"Well, I’ve been thinking, and maybe I’m ready to take things a little faster."
24886,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"Oh, great."
24887,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,Mm-hmm.
24888,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"And I promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you’re gonna get."
24889,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"You know, just-just one thing. Look, we’re in a really great place right now, and I don’t want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again."
24890,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,So we won’t let it get weird.
24891,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, I got a Cookie Monster tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing."
24892,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,What about
24893,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,Cookies!
24894,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,Amy? Amy? Amy?
24895,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,"Seven o’clock, right on time."
24896,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,It’s not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.
24897,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,"Well, dinner’s almost ready."
24898,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, that’s a hot date."
24899,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,"Tempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight."
24900,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?
24901,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,"With our friends moving forward in their relationships, I’ve decided that we should make progress in ours as well."
24902,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didn’t even know each other, and now I’m in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?"
24903,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,"I had a feeling you’d be reluctant, which is why I’m going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks."
24904,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away."
24905,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.
24906,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope you’re not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there’s only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that’s called school."
24907,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,"Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. I’m going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me."
24908,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"Well, seems what’s on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock."
24909,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,"We’ll see. Let’s start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?"
24910,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,Super Mario Bros. theme?
24911,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,Yes.
24912,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"I see what you’re doing. You’re attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won’t work."
24913,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,Fine. There’s no reason we still can’t have a lovely dinner. Why don’t you have a seat.
24914,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"Da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink."
24915,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,May I offer you something to drink?
24916,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,You know I don’t drink.
24917,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,Not even strawberry Quik?
24918,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"I love strawberry Quik. It’s my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol."
24919,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,"Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared for dinner."
24920,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!
24921,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,Just like your mommy used to make.
24922,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"Oh yummy, yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh."
24923,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"I’m sorry. I did, I crossed a line. I didn’t mean to!"
24924,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?
24925,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"I don’t know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time."
24926,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"Okay, well, they sure as hell don’t say that."
24927,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,It was the heat of the moment.
24928,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?"
24929,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"I’m sorry. Just, just give me another chance."
24930,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?"
24931,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"Again, I’m sorry. You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married, I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back."
24932,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"You can’t take something like that back. I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?"
24933,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"Okay, at some point, we’ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don’t we just start doing that now?"
24934,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,You’re kidding.
24935,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny."
24936,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,It’s not funny.
24937,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.
24938,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Hey, I was thinking. For our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from Dirty Dancing?"
24939,5,23,the launch acceleration,Bernadette,You’re kidding.
24940,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"No, come on. How cool would that be? Me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air."
24941,5,23,the launch acceleration,Bernadette,"Oh, you’re in a good mood."
24942,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Yeah, well, why wouldn’t I be? You know, I’m marrying the girl of my dreams, and I finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon."
24943,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Oh, hang on. Oh, it’s NASA. Wolowitz. Oh! Hi, Dave. What’s up? No kidding. Really? Well, that’s great news. Great, great news. All right, I’ll watch my e-mail for the details. Okay, talk soon."
24944,5,23,the launch acceleration,Bernadette,What’s so great?
24945,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,It looks like I’m going into space after all.
24946,5,23,the launch acceleration,Bernadette,"Oh, Howie, that’s wonderful!"
24947,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Uh-huh, wonderful. Yay."
24948,5,23,the launch acceleration,Bernadette,What happened? I thought they cancelled your mission.
24949,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Th-They did. But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they’re putting me on an earlier launch."
24950,5,23,the launch acceleration,Bernadette,When?
24951,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,A week from Friday.
24952,5,23,the launch acceleration,Bernadette,What? We’re getting married that Sunday.
24953,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"You’re right. I, I can’t go to space. I have to get married, and no one can say that’s not a good reason. I’ll call him back."
24954,5,23,the launch acceleration,Bernadette,Wait. I don’t want to be the one who stands in your way.
24955,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Well, too bad, you already did. It’s a done deal. Oh, well. But I forgive you."
24956,5,23,the launch acceleration,Bernadette,"No. That’s not how I want to start our marriage, killing your dream. We’ll have the wedding when you get back."
24957,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,But what about all the plans and the guests?
24958,5,23,the launch acceleration,Bernadette,We’ll call them. Although my dad’s gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits.
24959,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"You’re right, he is! Your dad’s gonna be furious. There’s no way he’s gonna let us postpone this wedding. Well, we tried."
24960,5,23,the launch acceleration,Bernadette,I’ll talk to him. He won’t say no to his little girl.
24961,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"No. I, uh, I should talk to him, man to man."
24962,5,23,the launch acceleration,Bernadette,"But, Howie, my dad can be a bully. He’s gonna make you cancel your space flight."
24963,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,We can only hope… that he doesn’t.
24964,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"Bishop to queen four, level two. Check."
24965,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?"
24966,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,I’m fine.
24967,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?"
24968,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,Very well. Can I ask you a question about women?
24969,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,We got you that book last year. Wasn’t everything in there?
24970,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"No, I’m having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way, that book gave me nightmares."
24971,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny."
24972,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"Look at us, Leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol’ ladies."
24973,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"I guess we are. So, what’s going on?"
24974,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"Believe it or not, Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy."
24975,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"I’m sorry, that must be very difficult for you."
24976,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"It’s awful. This morning, she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It, it’s usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception."
24977,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,Shame on her.
24978,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"They let me blow the whistle, Leonard."
24979,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,She’s good.
24980,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.
24981,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"You mean, like in bed or in the shower?"
24982,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example, this morning, I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy’s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?"
24983,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"Well, if you had a physical relationship, I’d say propose during sex. Turns out that’s a real mood killer."
24984,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,I assume we’re talking about you now?
24985,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,Yeah.
24986,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"So, that’s how this works? I complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?"
24987,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,Pretty much.
24988,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"Well, no wonder the women are winning."
24989,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?"
24990,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,I’m just looking at some old pictures. Come on in.
24991,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Family pictures, or… holy crap, that’s a dead person."
24992,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,"Last murder case before I retired. How many bodies do you see there? Careful, it’s a trick question."
24993,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,I’m not sure.
24994,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,"Nah, you’ll never get it. It’s a fraction."
24995,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"How about that. Anyway, sir, I need to talk to you about something."
24996,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,Walnut?
24997,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"No, thank you. I’m allergic."
24998,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,"Oh, sure. My partner used to have that. He’s dead now."
24999,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,From nuts?
25000,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,"Nah, his wife shot him. But she was nuts, so in a way."
25001,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Nice story. Anyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you is NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station."
25002,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,"Yeah, so?"
25003,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"So, the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter. Now, I know what you’re going to say, I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family and I’ve got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing. Well, message heard and understood. Mission cancelled. Thank you."
25004,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,Where are you going?
25005,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,I’m sorry. May I be excused?
25006,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,"No, you may not. Let me tell you something. When I first met you… You just gonna stand there?"
25007,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"I’m sorry, I didn’t know, is this going to… Well, I should sit… May I be seat… Well, I’ll just sit."
25008,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,"When I first met you, I didn’t like you."
25009,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"I’m aware of that, sir."
25010,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,But then you and I had some time together.
25011,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,Uh-huh.
25012,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,It did not get better.
25013,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Right, right."
25014,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,"That silly Beatle haircut and you riding around on a red Vespa, and you still living at home with your mother. To be honest, I thought Bernadette chose you to punish me. But then I heard about your astronaut thing, and I realized I judged you too fast. Maybe you are the right guy for my little girl."
25015,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Oh, I am. And just so you know, I’d still be an astronaut, even if I didn’t go to space. I’ve got an I.D. Card and a NASA golf shirt."
25016,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,"No, no, you got to go. You can’t turn down an opportunity like this."
25017,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,But what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?
25018,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,"You let me worry about that. You go up to that space station, and you make me proud."
25019,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"Um, okay."
25020,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,You got a problem with that?
25021,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,"All right, look, I’m gonna level with you. I’m terrified about going into space. What if I don’t make it back?"
25022,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,"It’s gonna be okay, son."
25023,5,23,the launch acceleration,Howard,You really think so?
25024,5,23,the launch acceleration,Mr. Rostenkowski,"Of course. A pretty girl like Bernadette, she’ll find a new guy."
25025,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,Hey.
25026,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,Hey. Off to work?
25027,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,Yeah.
25028,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,Have a nice night.
25029,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"Okay, you, too."
25030,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"Penny, just, wait. I’ve been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night."
25031,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,"Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it, too."
25032,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,I noticed you never answered me.
25033,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,You’re right.
25034,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,"Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?"
25035,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,Yep.
25036,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,Is it still weird ’cause I proposed?
25037,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,Yep.
25038,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?
25039,5,23,the launch acceleration,Penny,No!
25040,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,I played that pretty well.
25041,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,"Hello, Leonard."
25042,5,23,the launch acceleration,Leonard,What are you doing?
25043,5,23,the launch acceleration,Amy,We’re playing doctor. Star Trek style.
25044,5,23,the launch acceleration,Sheldon,"I’m in hell, Leonard. Don’t stop."
25045,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into Lucy’s eyes."
25046,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"Oh, that sounds romantic."
25047,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.
25048,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?"
25049,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"I’d love that, but she’s not really comfortable around people."
25050,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek."
25051,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,How’s that been working for you?
25052,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt."
25053,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Howard,"Leonard, I may have gotten you a job."
25054,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,I have a job.
25055,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim."
25056,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Howard,"No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking’s team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. One of their experimental physicists dropped out, and I recommended you."
25057,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"Well, do you really think I have a shot?"
25058,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Howard,"Yeah, I’ve worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He knows your research. I think this could happen."
25059,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"He knows, wow."
25060,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Well, now, but do you think that’s a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?"
25061,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Hey, don’t discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity."
25062,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"No one asked you, Uhura."
25063,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?
25064,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,What do you think?
25065,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,Great. I’ve been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?
25066,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.
25067,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Well, that’s the thing about factoids, they’re interesting."
25068,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,I know what you’re doing. You don’t want me going on this research trip because you’re afraid to be alone.
25069,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"I’m not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning."
25070,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,Sheldon.
25071,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Fine, no more drowning talk. I’ll change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?"
25072,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that’s going to stop me."
25073,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesn’t change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?"
25074,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by."
25075,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Lucy,Wow. Your friend was actually up there?
25076,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt
25077,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Lucy,Did he take the T-shirt to space?
25078,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Nope. It’s exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?"
25079,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Lucy,I don’t know. How many are there?
25080,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Let’s see. Six. That’s pretty cool, I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra."
25081,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Lucy,"Six strangers? That’s a lot of pressure. Staring at me, asking me personal questions. Like, what do you do? Where are you from? Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom?"
25082,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?"
25083,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Lucy,Will you be there?
25084,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,Of course.
25085,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Lucy,"Well, that’s two. Three if you count me. Oh, this is getting out of hand."
25086,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself."
25087,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"Oh, that’s awful."
25088,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the biggest tip of my life."
25089,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?"
25090,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,I thought I said that to you.
25091,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"Anyway, Stephen Hawking’s team is looking into that, and I’ve been invited to join them."
25092,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Wow, Hawking. Good for you."
25093,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"Well, it is. Just, you know, I’d be gone for a while."
25094,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Well, how long?"
25095,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"Three, four months."
25096,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,Whoa. When would you leave?
25097,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,Couple of weeks.
25098,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Wow. Oh, okay, well, I’ll just come visit you."
25099,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"That’s the thing, you can’t. I’ll be on a ship in the North Sea."
25100,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,On a ship? Aren’t they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?
25101,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"Uh, he’s not gonna be there. He’s just sending a team to research his theory."
25102,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months."
25103,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"Yeah. And I’m a little worried because things between us have been so great, and I’d hate to do anything that screws that up."
25104,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Oh, sweetie, if you’re gonna screw things up, it’s gonna be while you’re here, not while you’re away. No. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I’m just basing that on how much I didn’t understand what you said about it."
25105,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,Okay. I’ll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.
25106,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,Okay. Good.
25107,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,I do have to ask you one favour.
25108,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,Sure.
25109,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,Sheldon’s nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I’m gone.
25110,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Oh, I don’t know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?"
25111,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one."
25112,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party."
25113,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Howard,Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they’re actually going on a voyage?
25114,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Amy,"Hello, Rajesh."
25115,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Howard,"Hello, Amy. Nice to see you. What can I say? It’s funnier with the accent."
25116,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"There’s beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys really don’t need to make a big deal."
25117,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Leonard, you’re being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so we’ll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face."
25118,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Sheldon, sweetie, shut up."
25119,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Bernadette,"You know, one of the things that helped me get through Howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left."
25120,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Bernadette, sweetie, shut up."
25121,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,Okay. I have a request to make.
25122,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Amy,And now he can talk. I want to cut open your brain and see what the heck’s going on in there.
25123,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway, I, I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one."
25124,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, gee, I don’t know. My schedule’s a little busy."
25125,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Actually, I was thinking Leonard."
25126,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"Oh. Thank you, Raj. I’d be honoured."
25127,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Howard,What the hell? I thought I was your best friend.
25128,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"You are, but you’ve got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger."
25129,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"You know, maybe she’d be more comfortable meeting a girl first."
25130,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,Good idea. Bernadette?
25131,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,What the hell?
25132,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Well, you’re very pretty. That could be intimidating to another woman."
25133,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Oh, yeah."
25134,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Bernadette,"Hey, you don’t think I’m pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?"
25135,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Howard,"Calm down, Bernie. You’re very scary."
25136,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Amy,It should be me.
25137,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?
25138,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Amy,"A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family."
25139,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Fine, I’ll do it."
25140,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Amy,"So, after I started dating Sheldon, I met Leonard, and then everybody else, and they’ve all been so wonderful to me."
25141,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Lucy,That’s really nice to hear.
25142,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Amy,"Maybe next week, we could all get together."
25143,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Oh, Lucy, you don’t have to answer that. Don’t put her on the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her."
25144,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Amy,Ignore him. He’s a little nervous ’cause he doesn’t think I understand the severity of your social anxiety.
25145,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,What the? Are you crazy? You can’t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!
25146,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Amy,"Excuse me, but I’m a neurobiologist. I think I’m a little more qualified than you to understand what’s not working in your girlfriend’s brain!"
25147,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Don’t call her my girlfriend. We haven’t discussed whether or not we’re girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that it’s out there, are you my girlfriend? By the way, if you say no, I’ll never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot."
25148,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Lucy,I think I have to go to the bathroom.
25149,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,We might as well go ahead and eat. She’s not coming back anytime soon.
25150,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"This is ridiculous, we’re shopping for a party and this store doesn’t even have a party section."
25151,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Yeah, it does, and here we are."
25152,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"You know, I have to say, Penny, I don’t understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this."
25153,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Well, I’m his girlfriend, of course I’m gonna support him."
25154,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Yeah, well, you’re his girlfriend for now. You know, maybe you’re not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other’s arms and britches."
25155,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the boat. I checked it out."
25156,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"It’s not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawking’s theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? I’m interested in the big questions."
25157,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard."
25158,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,I’m not jealous. I’m just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.
25159,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn’t take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn’t very good at her job."
25160,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,It was you.
25161,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"It wasn’t me. But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair…"
25162,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.
25163,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, I’m happy for you. Because that’s what friends do."
25164,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,They lie so they don’t look petty.
25165,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,Yeah.
25166,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,How?
25167,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,Like this. I am so happy for you.
25168,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,Wow. No wonder you didn’t get that toothpaste commercial.
25169,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,Hey.
25170,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Lucy,Hi.
25171,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely out of line. Are you, are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?"
25172,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Lucy,Amy wasn’t the problem.
25173,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Okay. I know. It was me. I, I pushed too hard. I’m sorry."
25174,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Lucy,Thank you.
25175,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"You know, I, I’ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends are having a party."
25176,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Lucy,A party?
25177,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"A little one. It’s, it’s a farewell for Leonard, so all the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won’t even know you’re there."
25178,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Lucy,I’m not sure.
25179,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Oh, please?"
25180,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Lucy,Raj.
25181,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Come on. Don’t make me beg. And I’m from India, so I know how to do it."
25182,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Lucy,Okay.
25183,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Yeah, thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don’t like them, in which case, they’re dead to me."
25184,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Bernadette,"So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?"
25185,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,Yeah.
25186,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Bernadette,Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?
25187,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,Yeah.
25188,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Howard,"I’m proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that’s really something."
25189,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime."
25190,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Howard,Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.
25191,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,It’s not a competition.
25192,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Howard,"You’re right, you’re right. I’m really proud of you, and I’m gonna miss you when you’re gone. And space beats water."
25193,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Amy,"Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming."
25194,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"She is. She’s just running a little late. You know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. She’ll be here. Just give it a rest, okay?"
25195,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Um, can I have your attention, everyone?"
25196,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"That’s, uh, B-flat, for those who don’t have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldn’t be happier for him."
25197,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"Thank you, Sheldon. That must’ve been very hard for you to say."
25198,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Well, I mean it. I’m really happy for you. And that’s how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers."
25199,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Howard,Cheers.
25200,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,Cheers.
25201,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Howard,It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.
25202,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,Thank you.
25203,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Howard,It must’ve killed you when I went to space.
25204,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Oh, no."
25205,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Howard,"Buddy, you okay? Oh, man."
25206,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Bernadette,What’s going on?
25207,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Uh, go ahead. Read it."
25208,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Howard,"Raj, I can’t come to the party. This is all just too much for me. I don’t think we should see each other any more. Sorry. Lucy."
25209,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,Excuse me.
25210,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Raj, I’m so sorry."
25211,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Amy,"Me, too."
25212,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys went to space.
25213,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Well, here we are."
25214,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,Yep. I’m really gonna miss you.
25215,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"I’m gonna miss you, too."
25216,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Penny, we’re in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. We’re breaking the law."
25217,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Okay, there’s no space in the white zone, so…"
25218,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone connections are pretty good."
25219,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"All right, you have to get out of the car right now. I’m not going to jail for you."
25220,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,Would you just relax?
25221,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, I see a space in the white zone. Quick, circle the airport."
25222,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,Did you bring enough inhalers?
25223,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,Yeah.
25224,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"And, uh, extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on It’s a Small World."
25225,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,I’m covered.
25226,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,Okay.
25227,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, a police officer’s glancing in our direction. We’ve been made."
25228,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,Calm down. I’m getting out. I have something I want to give you.
25229,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Oh, Leonard."
25230,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"It’s just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonard’s face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance. Now move, move, move."
25231,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,I love you.
25232,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Leonard,"I love you, too."
25233,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Sheldon,"Don’t worry, Officer. They just love each other. We’re not smuggling drugs."
25234,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Raj, it’s Penny. Are you in there?"
25235,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,Hang on.
25236,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,Hey. I’m just coming back from the airport. I wanted to see how you’re doing.
25237,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"That’s, that’s very nice of you. Uh, come, come. Come on in."
25238,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Can’t stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. He’s gonna go through that activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so… Are you okay?"
25239,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,No.
25240,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,Oh. I’m so sorry.
25241,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"No. It’s my fault. You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I, I drove her away."
25242,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Oh, Raj."
25243,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Penny, I, I miss her already."
25244,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"I know how you feel. I miss Leonard, too."
25245,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"What’s like, what is wrong with me? Why, why can’t I ever have love?"
25246,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,You will.
25247,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"No, I, I won’t. I’m, I’m unlovable."
25248,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,That’s just the booze talking.
25249,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"No, it’s not. I haven’t had a drink since last night."
25250,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,You’re talking to me.
25251,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,I am. And now I’m crying for a whole different reason!
25252,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,"Oh, me, too."
25253,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,So I guess what I’m saying is I get where Lucy’s coming from.
25254,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Penny,That’s great. Do you want some wine?
25255,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"Uh, no, water’s fine. Anyhow, I’ve been thinking about it a lot and, and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space, maybe there’s still a future for us. Yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes…"
25256,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Amy,Does he ever shut up?
25257,5,24,the bon voyage reaction,Raj,"… but then it turns good again, and that means it’s better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now, thing’s aren’t good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. But I’m a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, it’s not all bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining…."
